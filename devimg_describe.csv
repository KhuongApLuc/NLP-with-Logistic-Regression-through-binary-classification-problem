"Galena, AK - A Yukon River barge docks at Galena, Alaska, while barge workers unload construction materials and other goods ordered by residents, Sept. 6.
 
Barges and aircraft are the two means by which residents of Galena get all the goods they need for daily life, and are also the only way in which to ship much needed reconstruction materials to the village.
 
Huge sheets of ice clogged the Yukon River on May 28, 2013, downstream from the village of Galena. The river's water rapidly rose and breached its banks, flooding the town, destroying homes, and leaving months of recovery work behind when the waters receded.

"El cubo de ladrillo casi perfecta fue construido a principios del siglo 10 y pertenece a un gran renacimiento cultural de la dinastía samánida (875 a 999). La tumba se deriva su nombre del fundador de la dinastía de Ismael, y no sólo contiene su tumba, sino también la de su padre de Ahmed, su sobrino, Nasr y otros de la línea de samánida.
 

El mausoleo toma elementos de arquitectura de principios del Sogdiana (por ejemplo, la esquina pesados ​​contrafuertes) y la adoración del fuego sasánida. La combinación de estos con la aritmética de los últimos avances y geométricas hechas por Al Khorezmi, Fergani Al e Ibn Sina y la última tecnología, el cementerio monumental servirá como una fórmula de arquitectura en los siglos venideros.
 

La construcción es de un cubo de 10,8 metros, con cuatro fachadas idénticas, todos ellas se inclinan ligeramente hacia el interior y sobre el cual se encuentra una cúpula semiesférica rodeada de cuatro domelets. Cuatro arcos internos con el apoyo de pilares de esquina forman la trompa sobre la que descansa la transición 8 y 16 caras en el tambor. Este chortak (""cuatro arcos ') fue revolucionario para la época y llegó a dominar un sinnúmero de tumbas conmemorativas posteriores. Desde el exterior, la zona de transición está enmascarado por una galería de diez ventanas que proporcionan luz y ventilación de las tumbas . El mausoleo es también rico en simbolismo. Su cubo no sólo remite a lo sagrado de piedra Kaaba en La Meca (Arabia Saudita), sino que además simboliza la tierra y complementa su cúpula, símbolo del cielo, para crear una metáfora del universo

The Tomb derives its name from the founder of the dynasty of Ishmael, and not only contains his tomb, but also that of his father of Ahmed, his nephew, Nasr and others of the Samanid line.



The mausoleum takes elements of architecture from the beginning of the Sogdiana (for example, the corner heavy buttresses) and the adoration of the Sassanid fire. The combination of these with the arithmetic of the latest advances and geometric made by to the Khorezmi, Fergani to e Ibn Sina and the latest technology, the monumental Cemetery will serve as a form of architecture in the centuries to come.



The building is a cube of 10.8 m, with four identical facades, all of which are slightly inclined inwards and on which is a hemispherical dome surrounded by four domelets. Four internal arches supported by pillars of corner forms the tube on which rests the transition 8 and 16 sides in the drum. This chortak (""four arch ' # it was revolutionary for the time and came to dominate a large number of commemorative tombs later."") From the outside, the transition zone is masked by a gallery of ten Windows that provide light and ventilation of the tombs fresh interior. The mausoleum is also rich in symbolism.

"A wonderful place in Milan City

The Milan Monumental Cemetery is located in an area of 250,000 mq. Inaugurated in 1866, it was designed by the architect Carlo Maciachini (1818-1899).

The construction first met the hygienic and town-planning needs linked to the presence of a high number of burial places inside the town. Moreover, the Municipality wanted to give the community a representative place by joining the cult of the dead. 

Within its walls, Monumentale gives hospitality to graves of different cults an religions, including the sections for non-Catholics and Jews.

The work of Maciachini includes different stylists suggestions according to the eclectic taste of the age and it joins together the Pisano Gothic and the Lumbard Romanesque style with some inserts imitating the Byzantine style.

The entrance square is dominated by the Memorial Chapel Famedio, a successful neologism indicating the temple dedicated to fame and giving hospitality to famous and well-deserving men. 

The sculptures and building of the Monumental Cemetery show the town historical events and its artistic history from Realism and Eclecticism, to Liberty and Symbolism until the contemporary age, as if it were a real museum in the open air where the main Italian artists are represented.

"In Buddhism a bodhisattva is a being with great compassion on the way to enlightenment, like having a tenure-track position to full Buddhahood. However, a bodhisattva does not wish to hurry in the pursuit of liberation but instead chooses to help other suffering beings. Ksitigarbha bodhisattva, called Jizo in Japan, is one of the most beloved bodhisattvas. The statues of Jizo usually sport red hats and bibs. A line of Jizo statues here in Kanmangafuchi abyss in Nikko at the banks of the fast flowing river Daiya. The flooding river has damaged a lot of statues, some of which have crumbled and just a few stones remain. The Jizos here are called ghost Jizos (bake Jizo) because they seems to appear and disappear into thin air.

Face of a ghost is hidden in this photo. Can you find it?

"Aussies and Kiwis do what they can in East Timor. Lance Corporal Thomas Vallas (front left), Captain Ian Cryer (front right), Deputy Commander International Stabilisation Force Wing Commander Samuel Leske (rear left) and the Commander of the International Stabilisation Force Colonel Michael Reilly with some of the $7113 US dollars raised by International Stabilisation Force Personnel to assist the victims of the Christchurch earthquake disaster.

NZDF personnel in Timor-Leste serving as part of the Australian led International Stabilisation Force (ISF) have raised over USD$7000.00 to help the people of Christchurch.

The earthquake in Christchurch had a profound effect on the NZDF personnel deployed as many of them are based in Burnham. The news of the earthquake was readily available to the forces in Timor-Leste and through the wide variety of communications that are available to personnel deploying overseas, almost everyone was able to contact friends and family within a few days.

The commander of the NZDF contingent, Wing Commander Sam Leske said, “We are all very proud of our colleagues in the NZDF who are helping with the relief effort. We wanted to do something to help the people of Christchurch and fund raising is just one of the small ways we can contribute.”

The fund raising activities, including a raffle and a collection, were enthusiastically supported by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) contingent in the ISF. With many of the ADF members being based in the flood ravaged parts of Queensland they were very much aware of the problems of being away from home during a natural disaster.

“The generosity of our Australian colleagues in the International Stabilisation Force is outstanding. It’s great to see that we come together in the true spirit of ANZAC and help each other out.”

Operation ASTUTE is the ADF's continuing contribution to the maintenance of peace and stability in East Timor. The operation commenced in 2006 following a request from the Government of Timor-Leste to the Australian Government for the creation of a multi-national security force to assist with stability operations within East Timor. The force, called the International Stabilisation Force (ISF) in East Timor, has evolved over time and currently consists of approximately 470 personnel from the Australian and New Zealand Defence Forces. The current rotation of troops is led by an Australian Army Officer, Colonel Mick Reilly, with Royal New Zealand Air Force Officer Wing Commander Samuel Leske serving as the Deputy Commander.

"Mount Ruapehu towers over the harsh alpine plateau thats called the desert rd. The thinner air and dry environment in obvious. I really boosted the red channel to make the shot more user-friendly as the raw file looked, er, raw....

Ruapehu, is an active stratovolcano at the southern end of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand. It is 23 kilometres northeast of Ohakune and 40 kilometres southwest of the southern shore of Lake Taupo, within Tongariro National Park. The North Island's major skifields and only glaciers are on its slopes.

Ruapehu is one of the world's most active volcanoes and the largest active volcano in New Zealand. It is the highest point in the North Island and includes three major peaks: Tahurangi (2,797 m), Te Heuheu (2,755 m) and Paretetaitonga (2,751 m). The deep, active crater is between the peaks and fills with a crater lake between major eruptions.

Ruapehu is largely composed of andesite and began erupting at least 250,000 years ago. In recorded history, major eruptions have been about 50 years apart- in 1895, 1945 and 1995-1996. 

The 1945 eruption emptied the crater lake and dammed the outlet with tephra. The crater slowly refilled with water, until on December 24, 1953 the tephra dam collapsed causing a lahar in the Whangaehu River. The resulting lahar caused a disaster, with the loss of 151 lives, when the Tangiwai railway bridge across the Whangaehu River collapsed while the lahar was in full flood, just before an express train crossed it.

"""This patio has several superimposed floors, laid to counteract the sinking of the land and the constant floods that plagued Tenochtitlan. The three small buildings, aligned with the wall of the Great Temple platform, have been given letter designations: A,B and C. They were built around AD 1500 (Stage IV)

Building A is the one closest to us. Its two stairways lead to the upper part. Only stucco plaster remains on the surface.

Building B, or the Tzompantli (Skull Wall) Altar is decorated with rows of human skulls carved in stone.

Building C or the North Red Temple displays well preserved mural painting. The style and decoration of its architecture evoke the Teotihuacan style.

"A Georgia State Park, near Cartersville. 

From Wikipedia: 
""Many archaeologists believe the people of Etowah battled for hegemony over the Alabama river basin with those of Moundville, a Mississippian site in present-day Alabama. The town was protected by a sophisticated semicircular fortification system. An outer band formed by nut tree orchards prevented enemy armies from shooting masses of flaming arrows into the town. A 9 feet (2.7 m) to 10 feet (3.0 m) deep moat blocked direct contact by the enemy with the palisaded walls. It also functioned as a drainage system during major floods, common for centuries, from this period and into the 20th century. Workers formed the palisade by setting upright 12 feet (3.7 m) high logs into a ditch approximately 12 inches (300 mm) on center and then back-filling around the timbers to form a levee. Guard towers for archers were spaced approximately 80 feet (24 m) apart.""

"Gold Hill Nevada. Virginia City Historical District.

Yellow Jacket Disaster was probably the worst mining accident in Nevada history. On the morning of April 7, 1869, fire spread at the 800-foot level. As the day crew descended, smoldering timbers collapsed, flooding poisonous air into the Yellow Jacket and neighboring Kentuck and Crown Point Mines. Fortunately, shifts were changing or casualties would have been higher. Nevertheless, survivors described horrible scenes of miners desperately struggling for life.

Heroic firefighters entered the mines, but flames and smoke pushed them back. At least thirty-five miners died, but some bodies were never retrieved, and single workers may have vanished without record. The fire persisted, so miners sealed off the offending levels, which remained hot for several years.","['©brentonwilliamcooper', '10mm', '1869', '19thcenturyamericana', '50d', 'american history', 'attraction', 'boom town', 'camera', 'canon', 'disaster', 'exterior', 'framed', 'ghosttown', 'gold', 'goldhill', 'goldmine', 'hdr', 'historical', 'history', 'hwy342', 'imagery', 'landmark', 'livingghosttown', 'mark twain', 'marker', 'metal', 'mining', 'nevada', 'nevada history', 'old', 'photoshop', 'place', 'planks', 'queen of the comstock', 'renodesertfoxstill', 'sshdr', 'storeycounty', 'street', 'the richest place on earth', 'the silver state', 'tourism', 'travel', 'webreadyimage', 'wildwest', 'woodplank', 'yellow jacket mine']",Yellow Jacket Mine,Attribution License,65392060@N02,jpg,-119.65878,5976464615,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1311656691,2011-07-25 22:04:51.0,39.290477,http://www.flickr.com/photos/65392060@N02/5976464615/,Renodesertfoxstill,

"Here is what I did to create these Star Wars cookies...

I used Wilton gel colors for frosting - leaf green and black. 
<a href=""http://www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?id=3E30B2D9-475A-BAC0-5D5C3DB846DFD354&fid=3E33265A-475A-BAC0-597A6ED538D55E2B"" rel=""nofollow"">www.wilton.com/store/site/product.cfm?id=3E30B2D9-475A-BA...</a> 

I used silver dragees for Yoda's eyes. 

I also used <a href=""#//www.williams-sonoma.com/products/star-wars-cookie-cutter/“"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow"">Williams Sonoma's Star Wars Cookie Cutters</a>.

Here's the recipe I used (from my coworker Jen Fritzler)...

<b>Sugar Cookies</b>
 
(NOTE: This recipe doesn’t make many cookies, so I made two batches of this recipe.)
 
Ingredients:
 
1 3/4 cup flour
½ teaspoon baking powder
1/8 teaspoon salt
¾ cup sugar
1 stick of butter
1 egg
3/4 teaspoon vanilla
  
   * Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
 
   * Mix flour, salt and baking powder in one mixing bowl and put aside.
 
   * Soften butter
 
   * Mix butter with the sugar in another mixing bowl. Then mix in egg and vanilla until everything is thoroughly mixed.
 
   * Slowly mix in the flour mixture into the butter/sugar/egg mixture.

   *Wrap the dough in cling wrap and put it in the freezer for an half hour or so. Bake the cookies the same day you make the dough or else the dough gets dried out and it is difficult to roll out if you are cutting out shapes. You want the dough chilled so the cookies retain their shapes. 
 
   * Roll the cookies out to about 1/3 inch. Make sure you don’t overly flour the dough as you are rolling it out, or it becomes more difficult to reroll again.

   * The recipe says the cookies should be in the oven for 10 minutes (on an ungreased baking pan - I use a silpat), but make sure you start checking on the cookies about 6-7 minutes in.  You know the cookies are ready if you start seeing the bottom edges of the cookies start to slightly turn a light tan (if it is darker than a light tan, they are burning).
 
   * Move the freshly baked cookies off of the baking pan as soon as it comes out of the oven, or else it will stick to the pan (unless you're using a silpat). 
  
<b>Royal Icing</b>
 
Ingredients:
(NOTE - you must sterilize all of our equipment and materials when making Royal Icing. If there is a speck of grease or fat on anything, your icing will fail and not set)
 
4 cups of powdered sugar
3 tablespoons of meringue powder (you can get this at Meijer’s and Michael’s in the cake decorating section. This is what hardens and makes the icing shiny)
~6 tablespoons of warm water
1 plastic “ketchup” bottle (you can also get this at Meijer and Michael’s in the cake decorating section. It costs less than a dollar.)
Dye (if you want the icing to have a color)
 
   * Use an electric mixer and mix powdered sugar, meringue powder and warm water together. Make sure you don’t over mix…you don’t want the icing to be “whipped.” Mixing it for about 1 minute is perfect.
 
   * Check the consistency. (Use the 10 second rule! <a href=""#//hanielas.blogspot.com/2010/08/10-second-rule-flood-royal-icing.html“"" target=""”_blank”"" rel=""nofollow"">Read here</a>.)
 
   * When you think you have a good consistency, add the dye and mix for another 20 seconds. For Yoda I used Wilton's leaf green gel color with a little bit of black. 
 
   * Now it's time to frost the main color of each cookie. Take the plastic ketchup bottle and cut the very edge of the tip off (so that you have about ¼ inch diameter of an opening on the tip). Open the bottle and start spooning the icing into the bottle. (You might not want to fill the bottle in case you discover the icing is not the correct consistency.) Make sure that you put a damp paper towel over the remaining icing in the mixing bowl, or else it will dry up.
 
   * Take a cookie and squeeze the icing bottle and trace around the perimeter of the cookie. If the icing is oozing off of the cookie, it means that you have too much water in the icing. You will need to dump the icing back into the mixing bowl and add more powdered sugar.
 
   * After you have outlined the perimeter of the cookie, go back and “flood” in the rest of the cookie. If you are finding that the icing isn’t really flooding around the perimeter well (even when you try to help it along), it means you have too much baking powder. You need to dump the icing back into the mixing bowl and add a little more water.  
 
   * After you have iced the cookies with their main color (yoda = green, darth vader = black, storm trooper = white), you need to lay the cookies out overnight to dry and adding the final details. 

  * After the base color is dry, it's time to add the facial details. I used Wilton round decorating tip 1L or 1S. I found round 2 decorating tip to be too big.

  * You can lightly lay wax paper or paper towel over the cookies as long as the top layers of the frosting is relatively dry. If you completely cover the cookies so that they don’t have access to air, the frosting won’t dry and the frosting tends to “wrinkle,” thus, ruining the cookies.

"Sayulita is a quintessential Mexican twon. Situated on the Pacific coast about 25 miles from Puerto Vallarta this town is a destination in and of itself. A car is unecessary, even unwanted as there is very little room to drive or park. dozens of cafes and bars on the beach and in and around the square make this a great place for tourists.The locals are very friendly and accomodating. We attended my neice's wedding here. It was like a dream.

Sayulita suffered a horrible flood in September 2010. It wiped out the two bridges over the river that splits the twon in two. It was just about recovered when we were there. I pray that the recent tsunami did not undo all of the work they have done.","['castal', 'cobblestone', 'flood', 'hdr', 'horse', 'mexico', 'nayarit', 'sayulita', 'town', 'tsunami', 'wedding']","Sayulita, Mexico",Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,21487041@N03,jpg,,5519648757,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1299948954,2011-03-03 15:15:32.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/21487041@N03/5519648757/,*Kid*Doc*One*,Panasonic DMC-TS1

"Yes, this is technically in Normandy and not Brittany but it was close enough to the border-line that we had to make an exception.

Amazingly, the rocky moutain actually becomes an island when the tide comes in and floods the entire plain (including the parking-lots and road/walkway).  Unfortunately we couldn't stay to watch the water rush in, but it is supposed to be an amazing sight.

"This is the backside of the yacht club before its renovation and re-purposing as a museum.  The North Shore Beach and Yacht Club or North Shore Yacht Club is an Albert Frey-designed building in North Shore, California USA.

It opened in 1962 as part of a $2 million development along the northeastern shore of the Salton Sea which would become California's largest marina. Several prominent figures from the entertainment industry docked boats there, among them members of The Beach Boys, Jerry Lewis and The Marx Brothers. Ever-increasing salinity from agricultural runoff from both the Coachella Valley and Imperial County combined with fluctuating water levels culminated in a major flood in 1981, destroying the club's jetty and making it impossible for boats to dock at the club; it would be completely closed by 1984.
Like the majority of the buildings which surround it, the North Shore Beach and Yacht Club was abandoned and vandalized. The shoreside swimming pool remained intact though badly vandalized as well. An often-photographed large advertising sign for Texaco Marine at the site of the jetty has now been removed.

In July 2009, Riverside County supervisors approved the reception of a grant of $3.35 million as part of an overall package of $30 million to redevelop and restore the property.

On May 1, 2010, the restored yacht club was reopened to the public as the Salton Sea History Museum, serving as a community center as well as a museum. The former pool area now serves as an activity deck while tSalton Sea History Museum","['ca', 'north shore', 'salton sea', 'united states of america', 'usa']",North Beach Marina at Salton Sea,Attribution License,48822492@N03,jpg,-115.937036,5723441295,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1305493538,2008-01-03 23:59:07.0,33.519127,http://www.flickr.com/photos/48822492@N03/5723441295/,SkinheadSportBiker1,SONY DSC-H1

"Monnow Bridge in Monmouth is the only remaining medieval fortified bridge in Britain with its gate tower still standing on the bridge.  Monnow Bridge was built towards the end of the 13th century on the site of an earlier timber bridge, the remains of which have recently been discovered. The new bridge had a defensive gate with portcullis and was in turn defended on the Welsh side by a ditch and rampart called the Clawdd Ddu or Black Dyke.

Pre-launch marketing for new gentlemen's outfitters <a href=""http://buckman-coats.com/"">Buckman Coats</a> - shot wide open using 5D Mark II.

This is a teaser - more to come.

Classic British tailoring with cutting-edge fabrics and manufacturing techniques. Traditional style and ultimate practicality for every occasion, smart or casual.

A Hipora PU coating makes the outer fabric 100% waterproof yet breathable - stopping the wearer becoming wet by keeping water out, yet allowing moisture in vapour form to escape and so avoid clamminess. All stitched seams are taped to prevent ingress of water. Unlike so many other overcoats, The Buckman is not merely showerproof, it is genuinely waterproof in the most testing conditions, but without looking like it was designed for scaling Everest. Teflon treatment helps prevent the material itself absorbing water or other liquids and guards against stains.

Each coat will be personalised with the wearers initials, hand embroidered into one of the stunning labels.
<b>Buckman - coming soon - the coat of choice for adventurers, film actors, racing drivers, fighter pilots, gentlemen and discerning scoundrels alike.</b>

When the White River was dammed, forming Beaver Lake, the abandoned, once-popular riverside resort town of Monte Ne was flooded and mostly buried.  With this year's drought conditions leaving Beaver Lake at its lowest point since its creation, Monte Ne has largely resurfaced.  While I was back home, Suzanne's family invited me along to explore the ruins.

"The site is cleared in anticipation of building the underground University Link light rail station at Capitol Hill. The station is just east of Broadway Avenue and south of East John Street, beneath Nagle Place. The contractor has begun installing the construction wall around the site. Steel beams will form the frame with plywood panels attached. Eventually, the wall will surround the entire construction site with art decorating the wall's outside surface. University Link is a 3.15-mile light rail extension that will run in twin-bored tunnels from Downtown Seattle north to the University of Washington, with stations at Capitol Hill and on the University of Washington campus near Husky Stadium.

"Grand Canyon National Park: the Bright Angel Trailhead rehabilitation project began on September 4, 2012. The area will be under construction through April 2013. NPS Photo by Kristen M. Caldon.
.
During construction, the informal parking area near the trailhead and around the Bright Angel Lodge cabins will be closed..
.
At times, Bright Angel Lodge guests only will be allowed to park in designated areas of the construction site; all permitted guests will be required to display a parking pass visible through their windshield..
.
Cars parked in these permitted areas without a displayed pass will be subject to ticketing and towing. Passes will be provided to permitted guests upon check-in..
.
Visitors wishing to access the Bright Angel Trail or other services along the rim are encouraged to park at Lot D – Backcountry Information Center; or, take the Village Shuttle Bus Route from parking lots A-C or parking lots located at the Grand Canyon Visitor Center..
.
At all times, at least one route to the Bright Angel Trail will remain open. However, through December 2012, either the southwest trailhead or the northeast trailhead will be closed for construction..
.
Fencing is located around the construction site and Rim Trail Detour signs are posted throughout for access to the Bright Angel Trail, Kolb and Lookout Studios, Rim Lodges, and Hermits Rest..
.
A rim trail detour map is attached outlining the current closure. The map will be redistributed as route closures change..
.
Work will include: a 90 car paved parking lot around the Bright Angel Lodge cabins; an ADA (Americans with Disabilities Act) accessible Rim Trail connection between the Hermits Rest Route Transfer shuttle bus stop and the Kolb Studio; reconstruction of stone masonry retaining walls near the Kolb Studio and near the southwest trailhead of the Bright Angel Trail; new restrooms and a meeting plaza with shade structures; and burial of utilities.",[],Sept 2012 - April 2013 Bright Angel Trailhead Area Rehabilitation 2292,Attribution License,50693818@N08,jpg,-112.143309,8047493270,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1349193216,2012-09-26 12:28:42.0,36.057287,http://www.flickr.com/photos/50693818@N08/8047493270/,Grand Canyon NPS,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D300

"Für die Pariser Weltausstellung 1867 wurde das Gebäude von Carl Diebitsch geschaffen und später von König Ludwig II von Bayern für den Schlosspark Linderhof erworben.
The building of Carl Diebitch was created for the World Exhibition in Paris in 1867 and later acquired by King Ludwig II of Bavaria for the castle Linderhof Park.

Das Schloss Lindenhof, die ""Königliche Villa wurde zwischen 1870 und 1886 durch König Ludwig II von Bayern errichtet. Es war als kleiner Rückzugsort geplant, ähnlich dem Refugium König Ludwigs XiV.
Dort, wo heute das Schloss Linderhof steht, stand bis Mitte des 19 Jhd ein hölzernes Bauernhaus, das s.g. Königshäuschen auf dem Gelände des Lynder Hofes. Dieses ""Königshäusel"", wurde 1873, um Platz für das Schloss zu schaffen, zweihundert Meter weiter nach Westen versetzt, wo es sich heute noch befindet.

The Linderhof Palace, the ""Royal Villa"" was built in 1870-1886 by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. It was planned as a small retreat, similar to the retreat of King Louis XiV.
Where today the Linderhof Castle stands, stood until the mid 19th century a wooden farmhous, the King's Cottage on the grounds of Lynder court. This ""Königshäusel"" was, in 1873 two hundred yards farther to the west, where it is still located today.","['bayern', 'ettal', 'graswang', 'heribert pohl', 'könig ludwig ii', 'königliche villa', 'königshäusl', 'linder', 'linderhof', 'lynder hof', 'maurisches kiosk', 'oberammergauer alpen', 'schloss linderhof', 'sony slt-a55v', 'wittelsbacher']","Schlosspark Linderhof, Maurisches Kiosk",Attribution-NoDerivs License,69460501@N04,jpg,10.958175,9676374013,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/,1378377369,2013-09-03 13:19:12.0,47.562164,http://www.flickr.com/photos/69460501@N04/9676374013/,Polybert49,SONY SLT-A55V

"Chalmette is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the parish seat of St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, United States. The population was 32,069 at the 2000 census. It is part of the New Orleans–Metairie–Kenner Metropolitan Statistical Area.

The community was named after plantation owner I. Martin de Lino de Chalmette, whose surname in turn is derived from the French word chalmette — ""pasture land, fallow land"" (used especially in a mountainous area) — and has been traced to the Proto-Celtic *kalm.

Chalmette was the location of what is often called The Battle of New Orleans, where United States forces under Colonel Andrew Jackson defeated the British in 1815. The battlefield is preserved as a national monument, and the military Chalmette National Cemetery is adjacent.

On 29 August 2005, the enormous 25-foot (7.6 m) storm surge from Hurricane Katrina came up through the Mississippi River Gulf Outlet(also commonly known as MR-GO) - a little-used commercial channel dug by the Army Corps of Engineers in the 1960s - and flooded most of the town, with waters as high as 14 to 15 feet (4.9 m) in some places. As a result, in a matter of hours, Chalmette was entirely destroyed. Fortunately the majority of the population evacuated shortly before the storm hit, but there was still some loss of life for many who had not gotten out.

As of 25 October 2005, most of the buildings were judged to be unsavable. Despite findings published by the EPA, the toxic chemicals in the water from local oil refineries have been postulated to be an ongoing health hazard by several civilian ecological groups. Especially notable was the large oil spill originating in Chalmette's large Murphy Oil facility, where the storm surge knocked over a huge oil tank (see photo).

The parish administrative headquarters served as the site for a FEMA trailer park for numerous civil servants who were laboring in the rebuilding effort. One year after the storm, parish employees were still working shifts around the clock to bring the community back to life.

Another center in the rebuilding effort was centered at Our Lady of Prompt Succor which served the congregations of the seven other Roman Catholic parishes as well as the main office of Catholic Relief Services. It also served as the only place to hold funerals for the first 12 months after Katrina.

Deputies working for the St. Bernard Parish Sheriff stated in early December 2005 that the oil tank floated in the flood. When the water receded, the tank settled on uneven ground. That is when it lost its structural integrity and the oil spill occurred. By late November, the Murphy facility was back up and running, as was a small cluster of businesses around the intersection of Paris Road and St. Bernard Highway, on the least damaged River side of Chalmette. The devastated residential areas further back from the River were only open during daylight hours for residents to attempt to salvage belongings from their home sites; houses often had been knocked off their foundations, if they survived the storm at all. The majority of people staying in Chalmette full-time were living in trailers, that started to be supplied by FEMA or private enterprise on Oct. 12; although many who had been promised FEMA trailer housing were still waiting as late as March 2006.

""Camp Premier"", now ""Camp Hope"", was established as a base camp for the community rebuilding efforts, facilitating the work of relief organizations, the National Guard and private individuals. As of August 2007, the camp is located to P.G.T. Beauregard Middle School and is operated by Habitat for Humanity to provide shelter, hot showers, laundry service, and hot meals to relief volunteers in St. Bernard Parish. Other relief organizations, such as the St. Bernard Project, have also participated in the rebuilding of Chalmette, from distributing supplies, to clearing debris, to preparing damaged houses for homeowners to return.

The Chalmette Battlefield was also partially flooded in low-lying areas, destroying the Visitor's Center, which was removed for rebuilding, and temporarily replaced with a house trailer to attempt re-opening the park for visitors in 2006.

"Campanile, Piazza San Marco
From the top of St Mark's Campanile, high above the Piazza, visitors can enjoy sublime views of the city, the lagoon and, visibility permitting, the peaks of the Alps. It was from this viewpoint that Galileo demonstrated his telescope to Doge Leondardo Dona in 1609. To do so he would have climed the internal ramp. Access today is gained via a lift that can cary 14 people. Nevertheless there is almost always a queue. If you are at the top of the tower on the hour, beware the resonant ringing of the five bells.
The first tower, completed in 1173, was built as a lighthouse to assist navigators in the lagoon. It took on a les benevolent role in the Middle Ages as the support for a torture cage where offenders were imprisened and in some cases left to die. The tower's present appearance dates from the early 16th century, when it was restored by Bartolomeo Bon after an earthquake.
The tower survived the vicissitudes of time until 14 July 1902 when, with little warning, its foundations gave way and it suddenly collapsed. The only casualties were the Loggetta at the foot of the tower and the custodian's cat. Donations for reconstruction came flooding in and the following year the foundation stone was laid for the campanile. The new tower was finally opened on 25 April (St Marks Day) 1912",['venice'],35,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,64893848@N00,jpg,,95232472,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1139044028,2004-08-06 16:30:26.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/64893848@N00/95232472/,Andy Bell,FUJIFILM FinePixA204

"Peblinge Sø (English: Student Lake). A single basin between Gyldenløvesgade and Dronning Louises Bro (English: Queen Louise's Bridge), which is the continuation of Nørrebrogade. The word pebling means little priest, and was used metaphorically for any student in the elementary and secondary schools in Denmark during the time when the church was the sole provider of education. 

The lakes primarily serve as a recreational area and the paths surrounding them are popular for strolls and a favoured running route.

"Vajont è il nome del torrente che scorre nella valle di Erto e Casso per confluire nel Piave, davanti a Longarone e a Castellavazzo, in provincia di Belluno (Italia).

La storia di queste comunità venne sconvolta dalla costruzione della diga del Vajont, che determinò la frana del monte Toc nel lago artificiale. La sera del 9 ottobre 1963 si elevò un immane ondata, che seminò ovunque morte e desolazione. 


La stima più attendibile è, a tutt'oggi, di 1910 vittime.

Sono stati commessi tre fondamentali errori umani che hanno portato alla strage: l'aver costruito la diga in una valle non idonea sotto il profilo geologico; l'aver innalzato la quota del lago artificiale oltre i margini di sicurezza; il non aver dato l'allarme la sera del 9 ottobre per attivare l'evacuazione in massa delle popolazioni residenti nelle zone a rischio di inondazione. 


Fu aperta un'inchiesta giudiziaria. Il processo venne celebrato nelle sue tre fasi dal 25 novembre 1968 al 25 marzo 1971 e si concluse con il riconoscimento di responsabilità penale per la previdibilità di inondazione e di frana e per gli omicidi colposi plurimi. 


Ora Longarone ed i paesi colpiti sono stati ricostruiti.

La zona in cui si è verificato l'evento catastrofico continua a parlare alla coscienza di quanti la visitano attraverso la lezione, quanto mai attuale, che da esso si può apprendere.


The Vajont Dam (or Vaiont Dam[1]) is a disused dam, completed in 1959 in the valley of the Vajont river under Monte Toc, 100 km north of Venice, Italy. A 1963 landslide caused the overtopping of the dam and around 2,000 deaths.

One of the tallest dams in the world, it is 262 m (860 ft) high, 27 m (89 ft) thick at the base and 3.4 m (11 ft) at the top. Its 1963 over-topping was caused when the designers ignored the geological instability of Monte Toc on the southern side of the basin. Warning signs and negative appraisals during the early stages of filling were disregarded, and the attempt to complete the filling led to a landslide, which created a wave that brought massive flooding and destruction to the Piave valley below, wiping out several villages completely.","['casso', 'dam', 'diga', 'disastro', 'erto', 'hdr', 'longarone', 'strage', 'torrente', 'vajont']",Vajont's dam,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,54707043@N04,jpg,12.336749,5828596842,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1307968628,2011-06-12 17:24:56.0,46.26899,http://www.flickr.com/photos/54707043@N04/5828596842/,n@89go,Canon EOS 350D DIGITAL

"It's difficult to find much information on the history of this temple, which is a shame given its impressive size and location (immediately in front of you as you exit the railway station). Evidently, it was originally built by the Khmers about 1000 years ago, when Lopburi was one of the biggest towns on their western borders; certainly the oldest monuments here are of Khmer origin. 

Later additions are attributed to the 17th century Siamese King Narai, who made Lopburi his capital, and the current state of the temple is at least in part due to simple abandonment after the royal court returned to Ayutthaya on his death in1688. 

It's also worth pointing out that there are no monkeys here. They are all further down the road!

I'd certainly like to return to Lopburi at some stage and re-take this shot. I think I could do a much better job of it now.

"The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrent-like behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near-flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between 0.56 m³/s and 3,540 m³/s. New dams built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.

The article describes a man walking from the soccer field in the park to the concrete bank of the river.  It doesn't say how he did it.  Did he cut this fence and walk over the railroad tracks, or did he walk around to Fletcher Ave. to a place where it's easier to get past the no trespassing signs?

Even thought it's called Rio de Los Angeles State Park, this is as close to the river as you can get from this park, formerly Taylor Yard.  The land between here and the river is called Parcel G, and the city hopes to acquire it in the future.  This is the area where there is actually the most hope of de-concretizing the river banks without causing floods, because it's the place where there is the most available land for the water to flow.","['california', 'lariver', 'losangeles', 'riodelosangelesstatepark', 'statepark', 'tayloryard']",Rio de Los Angeles State Park,Attribution License,90809455@N00,jpg,-118.236,4032546103,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1256162523,2009-10-21 15:02:03.0,34.096648,http://www.flickr.com/photos/90809455@N00/4032546103/,lavocado@sbcglobal.net,

It doesn't look like much. Some mundane hillside you passwithout thinking.

But those lines mean something- time, long passages of time. If I got anything from my years of studying geology, it was an appreciation for spans of time that do not even make sense on a human scale. 

In this hillside are eons (maybe) of rivers flowing past, meandering back and forth, drying and flooding, animals living/dying, entire generations coming and going...  and all this stuff of importance, is a blink.

"Low water crossing.

<b>Blanco State Park, Blanco, Texas</b> - A small state park, situated right in the middle of the central Texas town of Blanco, approximately an hour north of San Antonio.  It is just a hundred acres in size, covering a couple of miles along the banks of the lazy Blanco River.

The park was created in 1934 with the help of the Civil Conservation Corps.  There really isn't anything special about the park itself - just a slice of undeveloped riverbank.  Plenty of spots for camping, and also a good place for fishermen, swimmers, and picnickers.  The park straddles both sides of Highway 281, with a couple of small dams blocking the flow of the river, forming large, placid lakes.  

I visited on a rainy spring weekday, the park almost deserted.  At the center of the park is a small dam and low water crossing, with a small swimming pool off to the side.  Walking upstream past several picnic areas, plenty of spring flowers in bloom.  One end of the park bordered by the Kendalia Road bridge, with an abandoned low water crossing.  Then back along the other bank to the other end of the park at the Highway 163 bridge.  There is one small nature trail, but that's about it.  Pictures taken March 31, 2008.

"Street flooding in the historic downtown section of Vicenza, Italy, Nov. 1, 2010.

U.S. Army photos by Jim McGee

Snow melt, rain and local flooding closed most of U.S. Army Africa and U.S. Army Garrison Vicenza, Nov. 1-2. The command and post will resume normal operating hours Wednesday, Nov. 3, with the exeption of DoDDS schools, which will remain closed.

Flooding in the Veneto region wreaked havoc in the Vicenza area, resulting in the closure of U.S. Army Garrison Vicenza and U.S. Army Africa Tuesday, Nov. 2, for all but mission essential personnel.

Residents are urged exercise good judgment and common sense safety measures at home and on local roads, and to stay tuned to American and Italian media sources for further information.

"This is a sandstone obelisk designed by Francis Greenway and built by stonemason Edward Cureton between 1816-18 to furnish Sydney's first public square and to mark the place from which all public roads in the colony were to be measured. It is literally the 'hub' of NSW, the datum point from which all distances in NSW were measured from Sydney. Its inscriptions record the extent of the road network in 1818.

The obelisk is designed in the Georgian period and detailed in the Greek revival style. The obelisk's form seems to be directly influenced by Georgian examples rather than Egyptian: Greenway is reputed to have based his design on that of Nash in Bath. It is also possible the source of the Macquaries' fancy may have been the pair of obelisks in the Passeio Publico overlooking the harbour in Rio de Janeiro, which they visited in August 1809. It is an elongated pyramid on a narrow square pedestal decorated by projecting cornice and base. The pedestal contains the original inscription and is surrounded by a low stone wall with a later simple curved wrought iron balustrade. Building materials are sandstone and a wrought iron balustrade. The sandstone would have been quarried locally near Sydney Cove, however the exact location of the quarry is not known. There are no other structures in Sydney that are built from this particular fine grained white sandstone.

The lettering on the Obelisk is incised blackened lettering of a Roman type face in a style that is recognisably Georgian in style, and is one of only four remaining examples of this style and period of lettering in the inner City. This records the distances to the major outer settlements at the time of 1818 - namely Bathurst, Windsor, Parramatta, Liverpool, South Head and the North Head of Botany Bay.

The <b>Reichstag building</b> in Berlin was constructed to house the Reichstag, the first parliament of the German Empire. It was opened in 1894 and housed the Reichstag until 1933, when it was severely damaged in a fire supposedly set by a Dutch communist, Marinus van der Lubbe,[1] who was later beheaded for the crime, although it may have been the Nazi Party who committed the crime in an attempt to flush out Communism. That verdict has been a subject of controversy over the years. The National Socialist German Workers Party used this event as casus belli to begin a purge of ""traitors"" in Berlin and to ban the KPD, the German Communist Party. The Reichstag building again became the seat of the German parliament in 1999 after a reconstruction led by internationally renowned architect Norman Foster.

Today's parliament of Germany is called the Bundestag. The Reichstag as a parliament dates back to the Holy Roman Empire and ceased to act as a true parliament in the years of the Nazi regime (1933–1945). In today's usage, the German term Reichstag or Reichstagsgebäude (Reichstag building) refers to the building, while the term Bundestag refers to the institution.

"The view from the foot of the access road.

A spare half hour before the Pipe Band played in the City Centre meant an opportunity for a wander around the grounds of Inverness Castle - the weather was bright but the sky was heavy to the south, and the rain did not appear unti later. Being weekend, there were no vehicles parked outside the Castle!!

There has been a Castle or fortress on the ""Castle Hill"" overlooking the main crossing of the river Ness in the centre of the City of Inverness for ad long as history has been recorded.  Other sites nearby were also used from time to time (such as at Auld Castle just east, reputed location of MacBeth's stronghold which overlooked the seaward approach to the city).

Castle Hill was however the main location - any army approaching down the glen would be seen a distance away! The problem was that whenever the Castle changed hands it was inevitably destroyed, either by the retreating incumbents or by the victors. The last such occasion was in 1746 when it was blown up after the Battle of Culloden. As such, latterly it served no great purpose other than to provide stone for other buildings. 

It was eventually rebuilt (as a castellated structure) in pink sandstone to beautify the Royal Burgh of Inverness - although in point of fact it was not actually IN the Burgh. It was an exclave of the County of Inverness, an island of “County-ness” in the centre of the Burgh. It thus became County Sheriff Court House, County Prison, and County Council HQ - and of course County Police HQ too. 

The building was completed in two parts, in the 1830's (main part) and 1840's (North Tower). The Castle was built from scratch (apart from some ramparts remaining from previous versions).

The Prison portion (part of the North Tower) was vacated in  1902 when a new Government prison was built nearby at Porterfield  (still in use), and thus the County Constabulary was able to expand into that part of the building. 

The front (Main Section) of the Castle - as featured here - was built first and is a better standard of stone work as befits its striking location. Quite why one corner is rounded and the other square is likely known only to the architect but despite not being ""matching"" the appearance is remarkably pretty (I think!)

“Inverness Castle was originally a 12th century earth and timber enclosure fortress, founded by King David I. In the early 14th century during the Wars of Independence, English troops under King Edward I occupied the castle, which was taken and destroyed by King Robert the Bruce in 1310. In the early 15th century Alexander, earl of Mar, founded a stone castle on the hill and in the 16th century George Gordon, earl of Huntly added a high square stone tower. Seized and badly damaged by the Royalists in 1649, from 1653-8 Cromwell's Fort was built at the mouth of the River Ness. In 1726, General Wade transformed the castle into the square Hanoverian Fort George, with a governor's house and a chapel, encased by barracks. Surrendered to the Jacobite army of Prince Charles Edwards Stuart in 1746, the castle was blown up after the Battle of Culloden. A dramatic mid 19th century neo-Norman castle now stands on the site, built to house the Sheriff Courthouse and County Hall and all that remains of the medieval castle are a deep resorted well and part of the bastion wall.”

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_Castle"" rel=""nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_Castle</a>

In front (south face ) of the Castle is a statue of Flora Macdonald, famed heroine of Highland folklore who encountered Bonny Prince Charlie during his flight after the Battle of Culloden in 1746 and who disguised him as her Irish maid ""(""Betty Burke"") in order to sneak him through lines of Government soldiers.

Flora and her husband subsequently emigrated to the Carolinas (now USA) before returning to their home on the Isle of Skye.

The brass statue - erected in 1896 -  was designed by Andrew Davidson, a sculptor from Inverness. Captain Henderson Macdonald bequeathed £1000 towards the cost of the monument.

With a Scottish hound at her feet, she is depicted looking out over the valley and shielding her eyes. This one of few statues which depict an animal (other than a horse).
 
The inscription on the statue reads (in English and Gaelic): 'The preserver of Prince Charles Edward Stuart will be mentioned in history, and if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour'.

"The full moon is coming up Tuesday.  This month I thought I'd like to find a new vantage point to shoot the full moon as it rises over Mt. Diablo.  I got out my map of the area and found several streets which appeared to dead-end up on the hillside due East of Mt. Diablo so I got in the car and began checking them out.

The first road I tried ended prematurely at a big iron gate crossing the road.  There was a sign there actually welcoming hikers to walk around the gate and through the pedestrian entrance to this exclusive private residential area.  So I decided to take them up on the offer, parked the car and slung my camera bag over my shoulder.

This was the first home I encountered along the road up the steep hill.   The first thing I noticed were the twisty meticulously sculptured shrubs... then the mini vineyard on the hillside, then the chateau at the top of it all commanding the estate below.

Further up the hill I did find a nice view to return to on Tuesday... but I also found another place in Danville which may be even better.  We'll see which one calls to me on Tuesday. 

I wonder if there is a place of honor on a wall in that home for a 30 x 40 Giclée Canvas print of this magical photo?  Obviously the owners take great pride on what they have created.","['hdr', 'photo by san francisco bay area photographer keith cuddeback']",Alamo Hilltop Estate,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,53661631@N04,jpg,-122.049221,6824197881,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1328463523,2012-02-03 15:08:11.0,37.846731,http://www.flickr.com/photos/53661631@N04/6824197881/,"Keith ""Captain Photo"" Cuddeback",NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D90

"Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church

Destroyed in the Second World War, the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church by Franz Schwechten was completed in 1895. It was a massive church with six towers and elaborate decoration (some of which remains). 

After the war, a debate whether to demolish or restore the building led to part of the church being retained and new church built alongside. This new church by Egon Eiermann is a stark concrete panelled building with blue coloured glass panels. A tower in the same materials balances the ""broken tooth"" of the old church. Internally the church is calming, lit with a blue hue by the small glass panels.

"Parc de Carles I
Més que un espai estrictament delimitat, els quatre carrers que creuen aquest parc el converteixen en una mena de puzle format per sis grans peces on conviuen personalitats tan diferents com els terres pavimentats i les àmplies superfícies de gespa. Saltant d'una banda a l'altra, un petit canal i llargues fileres d'arbres donen continuïtat i coherència paisatgística al conjunt.
Situat en el vèrtex del Parc de la Ciutadella, el Parc de Carles I esdevé una mena de pòrtic de la Vila Olímpica, que és cap a on es dirigeix el seu traçat. A la confluència entre els carrers Wellington i Marina, el parc s'eleva damunt de murs de pedra i avança deixant enrere les vies de l'estació de França. Aquesta és una zona que s'inicia amb un espai fonamentalment pavimentat, on hi ha una àrea de joc infantil i on comença el seu recorregut un petit canal que voreja gairebé tot el parc.
La connexió dels arbres
En aquesta primera peça és on comença la llarga filera d'altíssims xiprers que, juntament amb les alineacions de plàtans, marquen el camí d'unió entre les diferents parts en què es divideix el parc. Un gran espai de gespa i l'aigua del canal caient en cascada per seguir el seu camí pel tram situat a la cota del carrer posen punt i final a aquesta zona, àmplia i elevada, del Parc de Carles I. Una mica més enllà hi ha la segona peça del parc, una zona sobretot de descans amb petits racons separats per tanques vegetals i un parell de ponts que permeten anar d'una banda a l'altra del canal abans que finalitzi el seu recorregut.
Els turons i la plaça
Juntament amb les fileres d'arbres, els suaus turonets coberts d'extenses superfícies de gespa són l'altre element que dóna personalitat i determina el paisatge d'aquest espai verd. Aquí són freqüents les zones de descans, que conviden el vianant a fer una pausa i seure una estona. L'altra peça amb personalitat pròpia és la darrera, a l'altra banda del carrer Doctor Trueta, una mena de gran plaça, en gran part asfaltada, amb un parell de parterres de gespa, arbres plantats en escocells i una àrea de jocs infantils. Un darrer apunt dedicat als propietaris de gossos: en aquest parc hi ha una de les àrees d''esbarjo més grans de Barcelona.
Vegetació
El Parc de Carles I compta amb una gran varietat d'espècies vegetals, entre les quals destaquen, tant per la quantitat d'exemplars com per la seva funció paisatgística, els altíssims xiprers (Cupressus sempervirens) i els enormes plàtans (Platanus X hispanica). Cal destacar els plàtans ramificats des de la soca, molt rars de veure en una ciutat, que hi ha a la part del parc delimitada pels carrers Marina, Moscou i Doctor Trueta. Procedeixen d'una antiga ""perxada"" o arbreda destinada a la producció silvícola (és relativament corrent que després de la primera tala no s'arrenquin els arbres perquè tornin a brotar des de la soca).
Al principi de la zona per on discorre el tram final del canal d'aigua hi ha tres bellaombres (Phytolaca dioica) de grans dimensions, una de les quals mostra nombroses arrels. A les zones pavimentades del parc hi ha tarongers (Citrus aurantium) i magnòlies (Magnolia grandiflora).
El Parc de Carles I és ric en coníferes, representades pel pi blanc (Pinus halepensis), el pi pinyer (Pinus pinea) i el cedre de l'Himàlaia (Cedrus deodara). Hi ha palmeres datileres i de Canàries (Phoenix dactylifera i Phoenix canariensis) i washingtònies (Washingtonia robusta), i entre les espècies arbòries hi trobem l'om (Ulmus pumila), el salze (Salix babylonica), el cedre de l'Himàlaia (Cedrus deodara), la morera (Morus alba) i l'olivera (Olea europaea).
Art i arquitectura
En aquest parc hi ha una de les escultures que es van realitzar amb motiu dels Jocs Olímpics de Barcelona'92. Es tracta d'El Cul, una peça de bronze de sis metres i mig d'alçària obra d'Eduardo Úrculo que va ser dedicada a Santiago Roldán, president del Holding Olímpic entre els anys 1989 i 1993. Úrculo estava molt content que ""Barcelona fos la primera ciutat occidental que té un monument al cul"". L'escultura, situada a prop del bosquet de cedres de l'Himàlaia, consisteix en unes cames llargues i molsudes que suporten dos glutis perfectes en la seva rodonesa.
Història
El Parc de Carles I és, juntament amb el del Port Olímpic, el de la Nova Icària, el del Poblenou i el de les Cascades, un dels cinc grans espais verds que es van construir als antics terrenys industrials del Poblenou a principis de la dècada de 1990.
Barcelona va recuperar aquests terrenys i en va dedicar una part a la creació de nous espais verds públics: els anomenats Parcs del Litoral. Aquesta actuació va formar part de la important renovació urbanística que es va realitzar a la façana litoral de la ciutat amb motiu dels Jocs Olímpics de 1992.

--------------------------------------------

More than a strictly delimited area, the four streets that cross this park convert it into a kind of puzzle formed by six large pieces where very different areas live together, such as the paved paths and the large areas of lawn. Moving from one side to the other, a small canal and long lines of trees give continuity and scenic coherence to the area.
Situated in the vertex of Parc de la Ciutadella, Parc de Carles I is a type of portico to the Vila Olímpica, which is where it leads. At the junction of Carrers Wellington and Marina, the park rises above the stone walls and advances leaving behind the railway lines of Estació de França. This is the where a paved area begins, where there is a children's play area and where a small canal begins which skirts the whole park.
The connecting trees
In this first piece, a long line of tall cypress trees begins which, together with lines of plane trees, mark the road that unites the different parts of the park. A large area of lawn and the canal water falling in a waterfall which then runs its course along the road bring this wide high section of Parc de Carles I to an end. A little further on there is a second park, an area especially designed for resting with small isolated corners separated by planters and a couple of bridges which permit the visitor to move from one side of the canal to the other before it reaches the end of the route.
The hills and the square
Together with the lines of trees, the sloping hills covered with large areas of lawn are the other element which gives character and determines the landscape of this green area. There are many rest areas, which invite the walker to pause and sit down to rest. The other interesting aspect is the back area, at the other side of Carrer Doctor Trueta. This is a type of square, mainly asphalted, with a few grass parterres, trees planted in planters and a children's pay area. A note to dog owners: in this park there is one of the largest areas for dog walking in Barcelona.
Vegetation
Parc de Carles I contains a large variety of plant species, among which the tall cypress trees (Cupressus sempervirens) stand out, for their large number as well as for their beauty and the enormous plane trees (Platanus X hispanica). It is worth pointing out the plane trees, situated in the part of the park delimited by Carrers Marina, Moscou and Doctor Trueta, which branch from the trunk and are rarely seen in a city,. They originally came from an old ""perxada"" or forest (it is relatively common that after the first cutting, the trees are not cut down again because they sprout again from the trunk).
At the beginning of the area where the final stretch of canal water flows, there are three large Ombu trees (Phytolaca dioica), one of which displays numerous roots. In the paved areas of the park there are orange trees (Citrus aurantium) and magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora).
Parc de Carles I is rich in pine trees, represented by the white pine (Pinus halepensis), the Italian stone pine (Pinus pinea), and the Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara). There are date palms and Canary date palms (Phoenix dactylifera and Phoenix canariensis) and Washingtonians (Washingtonia robusta), and among the tree species we can find the Siberian elm (Ulmus pumila), the weeping willow (Salix babylonica), the Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), the mulberry (Morus alba) and the olive tree (Olea europaea).
Art and architecture
This park holds one of the sculptures built to celebrate the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. It is El Cul (The Bottom), a bronze piece 6.5 metres high by Eduardo Úrculo, and was dedicated to Santiago Roldan, the President of the Holding Olímpic between 1989 and 1993. Úrculo was very pleased that ""Barcelona was the first Western city to have a monument dedicated to the bottom"". The sculpture, situated next to the Himalayan cedar forest, consists of long thick legs supporting two perfectly round buttocks.
History
Parc de Carles I is, together with Parc del Port Olímpic, Parc de la Nova Icària, Parc del Poblenou and Parc de les Cascades, one of the five large green areas which were built on the old industrial land of Poblenou at the beginning of the 1990s.
Barcelona recovered this land and dedicated part of it to the creation of new green public areas: the Parcs del Litoral. This project formed part of the important urban renovation which was carried out to the coastline of the city in preparation for the 1992 Olympic Games.

------------------------------------------

Más que un espacio estrictamente delimitado, las cuatro calles que cruzan este parque lo convierten en una especie de puzle formado por seis grandes piezas donde conviven personalidades tan diferentes como los suelos pavimentados y las amplias superficies de césped. Saltando de un lado para otro, un pequeño canal y largas hileras de árboles dan continuidad y coherencia paisajística al conjunto.
Situado en el vértice del parque de La Ciutadella, el parque de Carles I se convierte en una especie de pórtico de la Villa Olímpica, que es hacia donde se dirige su trazado. En la confluencia entre las calles Wellington y Marina, el parque se eleva sobre muros de piedra y avanza dejando atrás las vías de la estación de França. Ésta es una zona que se inicia con un espacio fundamentalmente pavimentado, donde se encuentra un área de juego infantil y donde comienza su recorrido un pequeño canal que bordea casi todo el parque.
La conexión de los árboles
En esta primera pieza es donde empieza la larga hilera de altísimos cipreses que, junto con las alineaciones de plátanos, marcan el camino de unión entre las diferentes partes en que se divide el parque. Un gran espacio de césped y el agua del canal cayendo en cascada para seguir su camino por el tramo situado en la cota de la calle ponen punto y final a esta zona, amplia y elevada, del parque de Carles I. Un poco más allá está la segunda pieza del parque, una zona básicamente de descanso con pequeños rincones separados por setos vegetales y un par de puentes que permiten ir de un lado a otro del canal antes de que éste finalice su recorrido.
Las colinas y la plaza
Junto con las hileras de árboles, las suaves colinas cubiertas de extensas superficies de césped son el otro elemento que da personalidad y determina el paisaje de este espacio verde. Aquí son frecuentes las zonas de descanso, que invitan al peatón a hacer una pausa y sentarse un rato. La otra pieza con personalidad propia es la última, al otro lado de la calle Doctor Trueta, una especie de gran plaza, en gran parte asfaltada, con dos de parterres de césped, árboles plantados en socavas y un área de juegos infantiles. Un último apunte dedicado a los propietarios de perros: en este parque hay una de las áreas de recreo de mayor tamaño de Barcelona.
Vegetación
El parque de Carles I cuenta con una gran variedad de especies vegetales, entre las que destacan, tanto por la cantidad de ejemplares como por su función paisajística, los altísimos cipreses (Cupressus sempervirens) y los enormes plátanos (Platanus X hispanica). Cabe destacar los plátanos ramificados desde la cepa, muy raros de ver en una ciudad, que hay en la parte del parque delimitada por las calles Marina, Moscou y Doctor Trueta. Proceden de una antigua arboleda destinada a la producción silvícola (es relativamente corriente que después de la primera tala no se arranquen los árboles para que vuelvan a brotar desde la cepa).
Al principio de la zona por donde discurre el tramo final del canal de agua hay tres ombúes (Phytolaca dioica) de grandes dimensiones, uno de los cuales muestra numerosas raíces. En las zonas pavimentadas del parque hay naranjos (Citrus aurantium) y magnolias (Magnolia grandiflora).
El parque de Carles I es rico en coníferas, representadas por el pino carrasco (Pinus halepensis), el pino piñonero (Pinus pinea) y el cedro del Himalaya (Cedrus deodara). Hay palmeras datileras y canarias (Phoenix dactylifera y Phoenix canariensis) y palmeras de abanico (Washingtonia robusta), y entre las especies arbóreas encontramos el olmo (Ulmus pumila), el sauce (Salix babylonica), el cedro del Himalaya (Cedrus deodara), la morera (Morus alba) y el olivo (Olea europaea).
Arte y arquitectura
En este parque hay una de las esculturas que se realizaron con motivo de los Juegos Olímpicos de Barcelona'92. Se trata de El Culo, una pieza de bronce de seis metros y medio de altura obra de Eduardo Úrculo que fue dedicada a Santiago Roldán, presidente del Holding Olímpico entre los años 1989 y 1993. Úrculo estaba muy contento de que ""Barcelona fuese la primera ciudad occidental en tener un monumento al culo"". La escultura, situada cerca del bosquecillo de cedros del Himalaya, consiste en unas piernas largas y carnosas que soportan dos glúteos perfectos en su redondez.

"During NTEN's 2008 Non-profit Technology Conference a group of techies participated in several volunteer projects to bring technology to communities battered by the 2005 Katrina hurricane.

My group, comprised of consultants, non-profit workers, and Cisco Systems, traveled to a community center in St. Bernard Parrish to install wireless access points. St. Bernard Parrish was the hardest hit during the flood - only 6 houses were left standing out of 25,000 when the water rose 25 feet in 23 minutes. 

It was an honor to be able to provide some help to this community and I'm grateful for the opportunity to talk with residents and keep the hope and momentum of positive work flowing.

"Block 11 was known as the ""Death Block"". It served several funktions, of which the most important was its role as the central camp jail. Male and female prisoners from all parts of the camp complex were held in this building. Most of these people were suspected by the camp Gestapo of involvment in clandestine activities: attempting to escape, organizing mutinies, and maintaining contacts with the outside world.
Poles from outside the camp who hat been arrested for rendering aid to prisoners were imprisoned here too. Following brutal interrogations, they were in most cases sentenced to death by shooting. In the early years of the camp the Strafkompanie (penal unit) and ""Erziehungkompanie"" (re-education unit) were also held in the this block. 
The prisoners of the penal unit, to which almost all the Jewish men and Polisch priests held in the camp at the same time were sent on arrival, were assigned to the most back-breaking work; most of them died.

For some time the block also held the ""Sonderkomando"", the special unit of prisoners employed to burn the bodies of the dead.

From 1943 on, Polizeihäftlinge (police detainees) were also held here. These were Poles from the area under the jurisdiction of the Gestapo in Katowice who were suspected of involvement in the the resitance movement. They would be held here awaiting sentence from a special German summary court. Usually the penalty was death.

In the basement, known as the bunker, were punishment cells where the SS confined prisoners regarded as guilty of violating camp regulations. In 1941 prisoners sentenced to death by starvation were held here.

Over the period 3-5 September 1941, the SS carried out experiments in the basement with Zyclon B in preparation for the mass murder of Jews: 600 Soviet POWs and 250 Polish political prisoners, selected from the camp infirmary as human guinea-pigs for this experiment, were murdered her in this way.","['abomination', 'auschwitz', 'birkenau', 'concentration camp', 'extermination', 'extermination through labour', 'genocide', 'gräuel', 'grauen', 'holocaust', 'horror', 'killing', 'konzentrationslager', 'lager', 'mord', 'murder', 'nazi', 'oświęcim', 'schrecken', 'shoah', 'terror']",Death Block - No.11 - Auschwitz Oświęcim I,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,61701037@N00,jpg,19.203007,7734142140,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1344360427,2012-07-29 17:36:37.0,50.027345,http://www.flickr.com/photos/61701037@N00/7734142140/,netmyller,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D200

"As the Mississippi River flows south, its natural inclination is to take the shortest possible route to the Gulf of Mexico.  Given its close proximately wth the Atchafalaya River and possible short cut through Old River, a change in the distribution of flow was changing with the rivers.  If left unchecked, eventually the Mississippi River would change course, overtaking the Atchafalaya River route through Morgan City.  To stop this action, the Corps constructed the Old River Control Structures to maintain the Mississippi-Atchafalya rivers distribution at 70-30.  Following the flood of 1973, the Old River Auxillary Control Structure was added for additional strength in maintaining this ratio.","['corps of engineers', 'la', 'simmesport', 'team new orleans', 'united states']",Old River Auxillary Control Structure,Attribution License,37671998@N05,jpg,,3834990608,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1250630513,2009-04-23 13:27:31.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/37671998@N05/3834990608/,"Team New Orleans, US Army Corps of Engineers",Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XTi
"There are three extant Donsbach markers in the Riverside Cemetery in Seguin, Texas. In the foreground is the broken (but somewhat repaired) stone of <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bellhalla/4978172234/"">Justine Donsbach</a> (died at age 20). In the upper left is the upright stone of <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bellhalla/4978163754/"">Georg Donsbach</a> (died at age 2; stone is in German). Inside the concrete border to the right of George is the marker for <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bellhalla/4978157460/"">Lizzie Donsbach</a>.

According to death certificates on file at the Guadalupe County courthouse, there are at least two more Donsbachs buried in the cemetery: Theresa Donsbach (1861–1918), and Andreas Donsbach (1848–1918). Given that the foreground area has room for probably another four or five graves, and inside the border with Lizzie is room for another five, it's possible that the pair (and others, maybe) could be buried here, but were either never marked, or their stones lost to the ravages of time. (The cemetery has had some vandalism problems and flooding in the past.)","['donsbach', 'headstones', 'riverside cemetery', 'seguin', 'texas']",Extant Donsbach graves in the Riverside Cemetery,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,73511718@N00,jpg,-97.962148,4977566919,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1284159170,2010-09-10 14:23:42.0,29.560394,http://www.flickr.com/photos/73511718@N00/4977566919/,bellhalla,Canon EOS 40D

"Jackson Mercantile is the oldest building in town, a well-stocked business with the biggest ice cream cone around. Inside, a combination barbershop and beauty salon displays a full-sized,mounted African lion. Rose's Cantina serves the best hamburgers you ever ate and includes a small, unique bar made from local logs. An enterprising gal named Paula Kirkpatrick owns and operates the Buffalo Gal Hat Company in the remodeled church, where she custom makes all types of cowboy hats and sells a large variety of Western gear. A couple of antiques stores and various services complete the business district of Jackson.

The town is three blocks long. On a good day the population might reach thirty, plus maybe a dozen dogs. Perfect.

"Shot this one out at my Scout camp's annual Klondike Derby on Saturday. Five Mile had some ice on it, in the process of melting, and there was a subtle pattern of cracks just barely visible. I knew the camera wasn't going to be able to pick up the pattern in any meaningful way, but I tried to capture it anyway, and see what I could do in post. Cranked all the knobs up to 11, switched it to black and white (since I think that worked better with the resulting graininess), and ended up with this. 

I like this more than I thought I would, but I still consider it a pretty big experiment, and I'm trying to figure out ways that I might have been able to shoot this differently.

"<b>Where's Zum-waldah?</b>
After getting Zuma situated perfectly, the only thing left to do before taking the picture was to find the perfect moment where no one was obstructing her from the camera's view. It took about twenty tries to get a good picture, since the location was a passageway and the crowd would fluctuate from zero people to too many people. 

The frog fountain on the right refers to Frogtown, which is what Los Angeles locals called the southern part of Glendale back in the olden days. Before the Los Angeles River was encased in concrete during the 1930's, the land in South Glendale close to the river would flood during the rainy season leaving numerous ponds from which thousands of frogs would emerge.

"Construction on the original stone city arsenal began in the 14th century, but was not completed until 1555. It was then completely destroyed by fire after only 16 years of operation; the current building was constructed in its place from 1574-75. Throughout its working history the arsenal served as Lviv’s defensive backbone. A smeltinghouse was located next to the arsenal and cast weapons for storage and for sale.

"Sony RX1 User Report.

I hesitate to write about gear.  Tools are tools and the bitter truth is that a great craftsman rises above his tools to create a masterpiece whereas most of us try to improve our abominations by buying better or faster hammers to hit the same nails at the same awkward angles.

The internet is fairly flooded with reviews of this tiny marvel, and it isn’t my intention to compete with those articles.  If you’re looking for a full-scale review of every feature or a down-to-Earth accounting of the RX1’s strengths and weaknesses, I recommend starting here.  

Instead, I’d like to provide you with a flavor of how I’ve used the camera over the last six months.  In short, this is a user report.  To save yourself a few thousand words: I love the thing.  As we go through this article, you’ll see this is a purpose built camera.  The RX1 is not for everyone, but we will get to that and on the way, I’ll share a handful of images that I made with the camera.  

It should be obvious to anyone reading this that I write this independently and have absolutely no relationship with Sony (other than having exchanged a large pile of cash for this camera at a retail outlet).

Before we get to anything else, I want to clear the air about two things: Price and Features

The Price 

First things first: the price.  The $2800  cost of this camera is the elephant in the room and, given I purchased the thing, you may consider me a poor critic.  That in mind, I want to offer you three thoughts: 

Consumer goods cost what they cost, in the absence of a competitor (the Fuji X100s being the only one worth mention) there is no comparison and you simply have to decide for yourself if you are willing to pay or not. 
Normalize the price per sensor area for all 35mm f/2 lens and camera alternatives and you’ll find the RX1 is an amazing value.
You are paying for the ability to take photographs, plain and simple.  Ask yourself, “what are these photographs worth to me?”  

In my case, #3 is very important.  I have used the RX1 to take hundreds of photographs of my family that are immensely important to me.  Moreover, I have made photographs (many appearing on this page) that are moving or beautiful and only happened because I had the RX1 in my bag or my pocket.  Yes, of course I could have made these or very similar photographs with another camera, but that is immaterial.  

35mm by 24mm by 35mm f/2

The killer feature of this camera is simple: it is a wafer of silicon 35mm by 24mm paired to a brilliantly, ridiculously, undeniably sharp, contrasty and bokehlicious 35mm f/2 Carl Zeiss lens.  Image quality is king here and all other things take a back seat.  This means the following: image quality is as good or better than your DSLR, but battery life, focus speed, and responsiveness are likely not as good as your DSLR.  I say likely because, if you have an entry-level DSLR, the RX1 is comparable on these dimensions.  If you want to change lenses, if you want an integrated viewfinder, if you want blindingly fast phase-detect autofocus then shoot with a DSLR.  If you want the absolute best image quality in the smallest size possible, you’ve got it in the RX1.

While we are on the subject of  interchangeable lenses and viewfinders...

I have an interchangeable lens DSLR and I love the thing.  It’s basically a medium format camera in a 35mm camera body.  It’s a powerhouse and it is the first camera I reach for when the goal is photography.  For a long time, however, I’ve found myself in situations where photography was not the first goal, but where I nevertheless wanted to have a camera.  I’m around the table with friends or at the park with my son and the DSLR is too big, too bulky, too intimidating.  It comes between you and life.  In this realm, mirrorless, interchangeable lens cameras seem to be king, but they have a major flaw: they are, for all intents and purposes, just little DSLRs.

As I mentioned above, I have an interchangeable lens system, why would I want another, smaller one?  Clearly, I am not alone in feeling this way, as the market has produced a number of what I would call “professional point and shoots.”  Here we are talking about the Fuji X100/X100s, Sigma DPm-series and the RX100 and RX1.  

Design is about making choices

When the Fuji X100 came out, I was intrigued.  Here was a cheap(er), baby Leica M.  Quiet, small, unobtrusive.  Had I waited to buy until the X100s had come out, perhaps this would be a different report.  Perhaps, but probably not.  I remember thinking to myself as I was looking at the X100, “I wish there was a digital Rollei 35, something with a fixed 28mm or 35mm lens that would fit in a coat pocket or a small bag.”  Now of course, there is.  

So, for those of you who said, “I would buy the RX1 if it had interchangeable lenses or an integrated viewfinder or faster autofocus,” I say the following:  This is a purpose built camera.  You would not want it as an interchangeable system, it can’t compete with DSLR speed.  A viewfinder would make the thing bigger and ruin the magic ratio of body to sensor size—further, there is a 3-inch LCD viewfinder on the back!  Autofocus is super fast, you just don’t realize it because the bar has been raised impossibly high by ultra-sonic magnet focusing rings on professional DSLR lenses.  There’s a fantastic balance at work here between image quality and size—great tools are about the total experience, not about one or the other specification.

In short, design is about making choices.  I think Sony has made some good ones with the RX1.

In use

So I’ve just written 1,000 words of a user report without, you know, reporting on use.  In many ways the images on the page are my user report.  These photographs, more than my words, should give you a flavor of what the RX1 is about.  But, for the sake of variety, I intend to tell you a bit about the how and the why of shooting with the RX1.

Snapshots

As a beginning enthusiast, I often sneered at the idea of a snapshot.  As I’ve matured, I’ve come to appreciate what a pocket camera and a snapshot can offer.  The RX1 is the ultimate photographer’s snapshot camera.  

I’ll pause here to properly define snapshot as a photograph taken quickly with a handheld camera.

To quote Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, “Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it.”  So it is with photography.  Beautiful photographs happen at the decisive moment—and to paraphrase Henri Cartier-Bresson further—the world is newly made and falling to pieces every instant.  I think it is no coincidence that each revolution in the steady march of photography from the tortuously slow chemistry of tin-type and daguerreotype through 120 and 35mm formats to the hyper-sensitive CMOS of today has engendered new categories and concepts of photography.

Photography is a reflexive, reactionary activity.  I see beautiful light or the unusual in an every day event and my reaction is a desire to make a photograph.  It’s a bit like breathing and has been since I was a kid.

Rather than sneer at snapshots, nowadays I seek them out; and when I seek them out, I do so with the Sony RX1 in my hand.

How I shoot with the RX1

Despite much bluster from commenters on other reviews as to the price point and the purpose-built nature of this camera (see above), the RX1 is incredibly flexible.  Have a peek at some of the linked reviews and you’ll see handheld portraits, long exposures, images taken with off-camera flash, etc.  

Yet, I mentioned earlier that I reach for the D800 when photography is the primary goal and so the RX1 has become for me a handheld camera—something I use almost exclusively at f/2 (people, objects, shallow DoF) or f/8 (landscapes in abundant light, abstracts).  The Auto-ISO setting allows the camera to choose in the range from ISO 50 and 6400 to reach a proper exposure at a given aperture with a 1/80 s shutter speed.  I have found this shutter speed ensures a sharp image every time (although photographers with more jittery grips may wish there was the ability to select a different default shutter speed).  This strategy works because the RX1 has a delightfully clicky exposure compensation dial just under your right thumb—allowing for fine adjustment to the camera’s metering decision.

So then, if you find me out with the RX1, you’re likely to see me on aperture priority, f/2 and auto ISO.  Indeed, many of the photographs on this page were taken in that mode (including lots of the landscape shots!).

Working within constraints. 

The RX1 is a wonderful camera to have when you have to work within constraints.  When I say this, I mean it is great for photography within two different classes of constraints: 1) physical constraints of time and space and 2) intellectual/artistic constraints.

To speak to the first, as I said earlier, many of the photographs on this page were made possible by having a camera with me at a time that I otherwise would not have been lugging around a camera.  For example, some of the images from the Grand Canyon you see were made in a pinch on my way to a Christmas dinner with my family.  I didn’t have the larger camera with me and I just had a minute to make the image.  Truth be told, these images could have been made with my cell phone, but that I could wring such great image quality out of something not much larger than my cell phone is just gravy.  Be it jacket pocket, small bag, bike bag, saddle bag, even fannie pack—you have space for this camera anywhere you go.

Earlier I alluded to the obtrusiveness of a large camera.  If you want to travel lightly and  make photographs without announcing your presence, it’s easier to use a smaller camera.  Here the RX1 excels.  Moreover, the camera’s leaf shutter is virtually silent, so you can snap away without announcing your intention.  In every sense, this camera is meant to work within physical constraints.

I cut my photographic teeth on film and I will always have an affection for it.  There is a sense that one is playing within the rules when he uses film.  That same feeling is here in the RX1.  I never thought I’d say this about a camera, but I often like the JPEG images this thing produces more than I like what I can push with a RAW.  Don’t get me wrong, for a landscape or a cityscape, the RAW processed carefully is FAR, FAR better than a JPEG.

But when I am taking snapshots or photos of friends and family, I find the JPEGs the camera produces (I’m shooting in RAW   JPEG) so beautiful.  The camera’s computer corrects for the lens distortion and provides the perfect balance of contrast and saturation.  The JPEG engine can be further tweaked to increase the amount of contrast, saturation or dynamic range optimization (shadow boost) used in writing those files.  Add in the ability to rapidly compensate exposure or activate various creative modes and you’ve got this feeling you’re shooting film again.  Instant, ultra-sensitive and customizable film.

Pro Tip: Focusing

Almost all cameras come shipped with what I consider to be the worst of the worst focus configurations.  Even the Nikon D800 came to my hands set to focus when the shutter button was halfway depressed.  This mode will ruin almost any photograph.  Why?  Because it requires you to perform legerdemain to place the autofocus point, depress the shutter halfway, recompose and press the shutter fully.  In addition to the chance of accidentally refocusing after composing or missing the shot—this method absolutely ensures that one must focus before every single photograph.  Absolutely impossible for action or portraiture.

Sensibly, most professional or prosumer cameras come with an AF-ON button near where the shooter’s right thumb rests.  This separates the task of focusing and exposing, allowing the photographer to quickly focus and to capture the image even if focus is slightly off at the focus point.  For portraits, kids, action, etc the camera has to have a hair-trigger.  It has to be responsive.  Manufacturer’s: stop shipping your cameras with this ham-fisted autofocus arrangement.

Now, the RX1 does not have an AF-ON button, but it does have an AEL button whose function can be changed to “MF/AF Control Hold” in the menu.  Further, other buttons on the rear of the camera can also be programmed to toggle between AF and MF modes.   What this all means is that you can work around the RX1’s buttons to make it’s focus work like a DSLR’s.  (For those of you who are RX1 shooters, set the front switch to MF, the right control wheel button to MF/AF Toggle and the AEL button to MF/AF Control Hold and voila!)  The end result is that, when powered on the camera is in manual focus mode, but the autofocus can be activated by pressing AEL, no matter what, however, the shutter is tripped by the shutter release.  Want to switch to AF mode?  Just push a button and you’re back to the standard modality.

Carrying.

I keep mine in a small, neoprene pouch with a semi-hard LCD cover and a circular polarizing filter on the front—perfect for buttoning up and throwing into a bag on my way out of the house.  I have a soft release screwed into the threaded shutter release and a custom, red twill strap to replace the horrible plastic strap Sony provided.  I plan to gaffer tape the top and the orange ring around the lens.  Who knows, I may find an old Voigtlander optical viewfinder in future as well.","['ahwahnee', 'champagne', 'east hills', 'flowers', 'grand canyon', 'half dome', 'justin', 'justin kern', 'kern', 'live oaks', 'national park', 'rx1', 'sony', 'sony rx1', 'stanford', 'trees', 'valley', 'yosemite']","Sony RX1, A User Report",Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,24894289@N08,jpg,,8632955627,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1365484066,2013-03-28 13:46:01.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/24894289@N08/8632955627/,kern.justin,SONY DSC-RX1

"Cemetery:  ARNHEM OOSTERBEEK WAR CEMETERY
Country: Netherlands
Locality: unspecified
Visiting Information: Wheelchair access to this cemetery is possible via main entrance. For further information regarding wheelchair access, please contact our Enquiries Section on 01628 507200
Location Information: Arnhem is in the eastern Netherlands. Oosterbeek lies 7 kilometres west of Arnhem on the road to Wageningen. From the Utrechtseweg, turn on to the Stationsweg heading for Oosterbeek Station. At the railway station, turn right on to Van Limburg Stirumweg. The entrance to the cemetery is a short distance along this road opposite the town cemetery.
Historical Information: Following the Normandy landings of June 1944, the Allied advance through northern Europe was extraordinarily rapid and on 11 September 1944, the Second Army entered the Netherlands just south of Eindhoven, the first Allied troops to set foot in the country since its fall in May 1940. Their next aim was to cross the Rhine before the Germans had time to reorganise after their recent setbacks, securing crossings over the rivers and canals that stood in their path at Grave, Nijmegen and Arnhem. 'Operation Market Garden' would involve the United States 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions, the Commonwealth 1st Airborne Division and the Polish Parachute Brigade. On 17 September 1944, the 1st Airborne Division began landing west of Arnhem, but German resistance, bad weather and problems with supplies and reinforcements led to heavy losses, and their objectives were not taken. They were forced to form a perimeter at Oosterbeek which they held stubbornly until 25 September, when it was decided to withdraw the remnants of the division across the lower Rhine. Arnhem Oosterbeek War Cemetery contains the graves of most of those killed during the September landings, and many of those killed in later fighting in the area. There are now 1,680 Commonwealth servicemen of the Second World War buried or commemorated in the cemetery. 245 of the burials are unidentified and two casualties are commemorated by special memorials. There are also 73 Polish burials and eight Dutch graves. The three non-war graves in the cemetery were Commission employees.

"Wat Phra Singh is a Buddhist temple (Thai language: Wat) in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand. King Ananda Mahidol (Rama VIII), the older brother of the present King Bhumibol Adulyadej (Rama IX), bestowed it the status of Royal temple of the first grade in 1935.

Wat Phra Singh is located in the western part of the old city centre of Chiang Mai, which is contained within the city walls and moat. The main entrance, which is guarded by Singhs (lions), is situated at the end of the main street (Rachadamnoen road) of Chiang Mai.

"06/27/2013 was Awesome Day in Canada, part of a Worldwide Day of Awesome! Awesome Foundation chapters across Canada and around the world held special events all on the same day in celebration.

In Calgary, we had to alter our plans due to the massive amount of flooding that hit Southern Alberta. Instead of our regular Pitch Event and planned giveaway of random AF swag downtown, we decided to run a Relaxation Station in the community of Mission in support of flood recovery efforts and flood evacuees and volunteers. People could rest up for a few minutes before heading back into the gruelling work of flood recovery.

Amenities included seating, shade, snacks and water, cell phone charging, a massage chair and massage therapists giving out free massages!

"Construction of the Gong Gong Reservoir near Ballarat. 
These photos were taken during the construction of the reservoir between May 1874 and August 1877. 
The reservoir was constructed by the contractors Young & McGuigan at a cost of 91,883 pounds.
Gong Gong Reservoir has a height of 70 feet, a capacity of 420,000,000 gallons and when full, covers an area of around 25 hectares. 
The reservoir was built to alleviate flooding to Lake Wendouree and as the primary water source for Ballarat.
The original photos were  printed by Bardwell & Beauchamp of Ballarat.
These photos are scanned from originals. They have also had their contrast increased and colour adjusted to reduce yellowing due to ageing.

"<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tynedale_Railway"" rel=""nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Tynedale_Railway</a> 

<a href=""http://www.strps.org.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.strps.org.uk/</a> 

The South Tynedale Railway is a preserved2 ft  (610 mm) heritage railway in England and is England's highest narrow gauge railway. The route runs from Alston in Cumbria to Lintley in Northumberland via the South Tyne Viaduct, the Gilderdale Viaduct and the Whitley Viaduct.
The railway is operated by a charity, The South Tynedale Railway Preservation Society, which was registered in 1983.[1]
Passenger trains operate on the railway between April (or from Easter weekend if in March) through to October each year and currently (2011) attract 40,000 people to the district every year.[1] Special trains operate including Santa Special trains on certain days in December each year. Although no Santa trains ran in 2011 as volunteer efforts were put into completing the extension to Lintley in time for the 2012 season, they will run again in December 2012 on two successive weekends, 15th, 16th, 22nd, 23rd.
At Alston station there is a cafe and gift shop both operated by the railway company. Free car and coach parking is available adjacent to the station which is located about a quarter mile north of the town on Hexham road.
The present line is now currently more than three and a quarter miles in length and there are plans to extend the line by a further mile and a quarter miles to Slaggyford. It is built on the southern end of the track bed of the disused 4 ft 8 1⁄2 in (1,435 mm) standard gauge Haltwhistle to Alston Line, which formerly connected with the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway at Haltwhistle. The standard gauge line closed down by British Rail on 1 May 1976 and the track bed is mostly intact. The Society has in its principal aims a hope to completely reopen a railway to Haltwhistle.","['alston', 'ca9 3jb', 'cumbria', 'railway', 'south', 'steam', 'the', 'the railway station', 'the south tynedale railway preservation society', 'tynedale']",The South Tynedale Railway,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,75711708@N00,jpg,-2.444715,8074657054,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1349893785,2012-09-01 13:12:55.0,54.811221,http://www.flickr.com/photos/75711708@N00/8074657054/,letscommunicate,Canon EOS 450D

"The Environment Agency are using the power of the railway to move heavy rock material to help repair a flood coastal defence scheme at Minehead. Until January 2011, the Environment Agency will build a 130 metre section of rock armour in front of the existing ridge which includes the coast path near to the Minehead and West Somerset Golf Course. The new structure will help keep the shingle material in place and to dissipate some of the energy of westerly waves, to reduce the risk of flooding to homes and businesses in Minehead, including Butlins holiday camp and the golf course. The West Somerset Railway will be helping to minimise disruption and reduce the number of heavy lorry movements by conveying stone trains from the mainline network to Minehead. The trains - headed by diesel locomotives throughout - will run from the Mendip quarries and the rock armour will offloaded near Minehead station and carried by road a short distance along the seafront. ""We were pleased to see heavy freight trains back on the branch line and being worked by us in what over the years has become a well-tuned operation. We will always be pleased to help in the future and where possible reduce the number of lorry movements on the local road network."" said West Somerset Railway General Manager Paul Conibeare. And Cllr Chris Morgan, Deputy Leader and Lead Member for the Environment at West Somerset Council, said ""I commend this innovative partnership working which significantly reduces the need for heavy lorries to use our narrow country roads. I am delighted to see these essential works get underway to strengthen this vulnerable stretch of coast to help ensure the future safety of the local community.""","['class 66', 'rail', 'wsr']",A rather rare sight - Stuad70 sitting on the fence.,Attribution License,81033635@N00,jpg,-3.192794,5167090812,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1289490805,2010-11-10 12:41:24.0,51.052469,http://www.flickr.com/photos/81033635@N00/5167090812/,stuad70,Canon EOS 300D DIGITAL

"Tan Hill Inn
The Tan Hill Inn is generally recognised as being the highest inn in England at 1,732 feet (528 m) above sea level. The second highest is the Cat and Fiddle Inn, on the A537 road near the Derbyshire/Cheshire county boundary and with an elevation of about 1,690 feet (520 m), though recent measurements dispute Tan Hill's supremacy.[1]

In 1995, the Tan Hill Inn became the first public house in the UK to be granted a licence to hold weddings and civil ceremonies, after new laws were brought in to allow couples to marry in places other than churches or registry offices.[2] The pub once appeared in an advert starring Ted Moult for window fitting company, Everest,[3] and more recently a Vodafone advert.

In May 2007, Kentucky Fried Chicken threatened legal action against the Tan Hill Inn for trademark infringement over the use of the term ""Family Feast"" on the inn's Christmas Day menu. But on 10 May 2007 KFC confirmed that it would not be pursuing the case.[4][5]

Revellers celebrating New Year's Eve at the pub on 31 December 2009 were unable to leave the pub for three days as they were snowed in.[","['arkengarthdale', 'beer', 'hill', 'm', 'moor', 'pub', 'reeth', 'tanhill', 'tents']",TAN HILL BACK VIEW,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,97728003@N00,jpg,-2.146625,2877309298,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1222038505,2008-09-20 13:54:23.0,54.458613,http://www.flickr.com/photos/97728003@N00/2877309298/,simontingle74,Panasonic DMC-TZ1

"Site of the former South Tyneside College In Hebburn.

These pictures were taken looking towards the college from the Gateshead side.

I think these pictures are of the canteen block and an entrance to the theatre hall at the back of the building.

Bound to be yet another below par housing estate sometime soon.

Since the college closed in 2011 it has been used for Police terrorist training (apparently) and a part of it was turned into a morgue for ITV's Vera police/detective program. 

Feel free to use these pictures but (if possible) please drop me an email so I can see how they are being used.

"What looks like a schoolhouse, part of the side yard pieces at Hartman's Rock Garden.

--
(Adapted from the description at RoadsideAmerica.com)

In 1932, in the heart of the Great Depression, Centerville native Ben Hartman began what would become a decade-long project:  an impossibly large and complex sculpture garden made entirely of small stones, in his backyard.

Hartman's Rock Garden began small, as do many instances of Dementia Concretia -- Ben just wanted to build a little stone and concrete fish pond in his yard. He liked the finished product, and decided that he wasn't finished after all. He scavenged stone from a nearby construction site, broke it with his hammer, added bits of mirror and pottery -- and began building little stone houses, cathedrals, and parapets with religious statuary in the side and back yards of his wood-frame home. He kept building for seven years. He had the corner lot, so his work was easy to see.

Ben built a replica of Philadelphia's Independence Hall, a White House, a Mount Vernon (Ohioans can't get enough of mini-Mt. Vernons -- we saw another in Lima). A large castle with a drawbridge and moat is composed of 14,000 stones; a ""Tree of Life"" has over 20,000.

Ben stopped building in 1939. We suspect that he ran out of space, materials, maybe energy -- but certainly not ideas. He used something like a quarter of a million stones to create Hartman's Rock Garden.

Although Ben died in 1944, his property was maintained by his wife Mary for many years, and even won the Community Beautification Award four times in the 60's.  The garden is now owned by Hartman's son, Ben Jr., and did not appear to be any longer upkept or maintained...pieces were falling apart, and weeds grew throughout (though this may just be a season growth).

Between the buildings (aside from the overgrowth) are little scenes -- a mix of history, religion, and Depression-era pop culture. Lawn statues of the Holy Family share space with garden gnomes. Small hand-written signs help visitors to distinguish one tableau from the next: Custer's Last Stand, Daniel in the Lion's Den, Noah's Ark, and ""Foot path to Pece"" (Peace).

""The sad part of war"" is rendered with little army men, fallen or missing limbs, and accompanied by angels. Meanwhile, a healthier army prepares to storm the castle...

Ben built a depiction of the Oregon Trail, a Nativity scene, a cup and saucer. Scenes of boxer Joe Louis and the Dionne Quintuplets -- a media sensation of Canadian multiple births -- suggest what occupied the popular imagination in the 1930s.

Our favorite hand-lettered sign:

"by Tech. Sgt. Benjamin Rojek
Defense Media Activity

5/4/2012 - FORT GEORGE G. MEADE, Md. -- Walking almost 90 miles, 36 Airmen completed the Air Advisor Memorial Ruck March from New York City to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, N.J., April 26-27.

The march, which started at One World Trade Center and ended at the Air Advisor Academy, was in remembrance of the deaths of nine U.S. air advisors in Afghanistan.

On the morning of April 27, 2011, an Afghan Air Force lieutenant colonel walked into the Afghan Air Command and Control Center at the Kabul Air Command Headquarters and, without warning or provocation, opened fire, killing eight active-duty U.S. Airmen and a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel. Those nine service members came from various bases and specialties, but were working together for a common mission: advising the Afghan military.

""It was a unique situation,"" said Lt. Col. J.D. Scott II, the march coordinator and chief of core knowledge at the Air Advisor Academy. ""It didn't happen for a particular base. It didn't happen for a particular squadron or base or even for a particular (Air Force Specialty Code).

""Because of that, remembering their sacrifice may not have been captured as a whole,"" Scott continued. ""The individual would have been honored at their base, but the mission of the entire of the team would not have been recognized."" 

Since all of the nine went through the Air Advisor Academy, Col. John Holm, the academy's commandant, decided that would be the place to honor their sacrifice as a team, Scott said. Holm made plans to create a physical memorial, but a plethora of obstacles made it impossible to complete the memorial by the one year anniversary of the tragic event. One of the obstacles was funding.

Holm and his team came up with idea of a ruck march to both honor the fallen air advisors and act as a fundraiser to help build the physical memorial. Scott was put in charge of organizing the march and, in just two weeks, succeeded in gathering people from Dover AFB, Del., to Eielson AFB, Alaska, for the march. Each marcher knew at least one of the nine fallen air advisors in some way. 

""Master Sgt. Tara Brown and Maj. Phil Ambard both lived three and four doors down from me in the dorms,"" said Tech. Sgt. Brian Christiansen, a photographer with the 145th Airlift Wing in Charlotte, N.C., who was deployed to Kabul, Afghanistan at the same time as the air advisors. ""Both were incredibly friendly people. And I met several of them (the morning of the shooting) as I walked into my building and opened the door and they walked out.""

Those personal connections to the fallen service members and their families drew the 36 marchers together, Scott said. 

""They were coming in from all over,"" he said. ""That's kind of representative of the nine that we lost. They came from all over the Air Force to serve a single mission as an air advisor. So the marchers that were honoring them came from all over the Air Force to remember them.""

Each paid their own way to New York City to honor their fallen friends and show their families that they haven't forgotten their loved one's sacrifice. The event also drew in another 14 volunteers to help with everything from transportation to food to health and care coverage.

The marchers were broken up into four teams, each set to march three legs of 7.3 miles. During their leg, each marcher carried a ruck sack with a paver stone inside, each stone engraved with the name of a fallen air advisor and to be laid at the memorial on JB MDL. 

Holm and his nine-person team kicked off the march at 9:11 a.m. April 26. However, rather than just start off near ground zero, the colonel wanted to do something more for his fallen comrades.

""We wanted to honor them by doing something significant, and to me starting at the top of the World Trade Center was it,"" Holm said. ""We had those ruck sacks on the entire tour. It was all symbolic and important to us in our own personal, different ways. For me, it was probably the biggest single gesture we could do short of opening up (the academy's) memorial ourselves.""

The significance of the march touched a lot of people along the way, starting with the One World Trade Center steel workers, who gave the Airmen a standing ovation as they marched through the structure. Other people along their route also showed their appreciation by stopping to give hugs, encouragement, thanks and even money toward the memorial.

As they traveled by foot from New York to New Jersey, state and local police departments provided escort, each district calling the next to inform them of what the Airmen were doing, Holm said. The marchers were even given a chance to rest and eat at the fire departments in both Elizabeth, N.J., and Jersey City, N.J. It was a sign of support of both the Airmen marching and the fallen air advisors, he said.

When the fourth team finished their last leg, the marchers were 1.1 miles from the construction site of the Air Advisor Memorial on JB MDL. All 36 marchers gathered together in formation and made their way through the base gate. What met them there was surprise to all.

""Security forces closed down the road and gave us police escort in,"" Scott said. ""There were numerous amounts of people from the front gate to the memorial lining the street on both sides, just cheering us on in. 

""The fact that the base community just embraces us and cheered us in on those final steps, it's very inspiring,"" he added.

It was an emotional moment for Christiansen as well. He was present at the base when the air advisors were killed and attended their dignified transfer ceremony. However, each person was laid to rest in different locations around the U.S., so he never got to have closure.

Christiansen said the real impact came when he saw the road signs leading to the installation. ""That's when it really started to hit in not that we're all going to do this, but this is for real. We've done this for the families, we've done this for our fallen brothers and sister. It was pretty easy to get caught up in the emotion there.

""The ceremony of laying the bricks down was really powerful,"" he added. ""It brought some serious closure.""

For Chaplain Maj. Eric Boyer, who said the opening prayer for the stone laying ceremony, it was a bittersweet chance to pay tribute to two of the officers that he had a connection to.

""It makes me proud to know that their sacrifice will be honored and will be remembered,"" he said. ""Every Air Advisor who comes through the academy here is going to recognize the price that has been paid by their predecessors."" 

Prior to entering military service, Boyer knew Lt. Col. Frank Bryant from their hometown of Knoxville, Tenn., where he served as Bryant's wrestling coach. 

Boyer also served as squadron chaplain for Maj. Jeffery Ausborn while at Joint Base San Antonio in 2011, but had already changed duty station's to JB MDL when he got the word about Ausborn's death. His biggest regret was not being able to preside over his funeral service.

""It meant a lot to me to be able to say something to honor his memory here, since I wasn't able to speak at his memorial ceremony back at his home station,"" he said.

While the ruck march and stone-laying ceremony brought some closure for Christiansen and others, the construction of the memorial itself is still ongoing. However, between the pledges for the marchers, donations received during the march as well as T-shirt and brick sales, Holm estimated that the team has raised almost $10,000 toward the memorial just through this one event.

""We have that feeling that we did the right thing just by honoring our comrades, regardless of what money we raised,"" Holm said. ""That was a tremendous feeling.""

An all-Egyptian team work at the site since November 2007, excavations under the direction of Dr. Zahi Hawass who believes that there are still many treasures left to be discovered.

The drainage channel for the ""tears of the gods"" 
In the area in the cliffs between the tombs of Ramesses II and Merenptah, Hawass and his team have found a man-made drainage channel that probably helped prevent the flooding of the royal tombs in the vicinity.

"An example of the collapsing riprap walls along the Anacostia River in Washington, D.C., in the United States.

""Riprap"" is a term that means ""uncut stone.""

Washington, D.C., founded in 1789, sits at the confluence of two major rivers, the Potomac and the Anacostia.  The Potomac River regularly flooded each spring.  In 1881, a massive flood hit the city. Water lapped the foundations of the White House, and Pennsylvania Avenue was under three feet of water.  Determined to stop the floods, Congress ordered that the Potomac River below Great Falls be dredged down to bedrock.

This dredging generated huge amounts of silt and earth, and Congress ordered that this be used to extend the Mall west and south of its boundaries.  This created the area where West Potomac Park, the Lincoln Memorial, the FDR Memorial, and the Jefferson Memorial are today.  There was so much fill left over that the Army Corps of Engineers also created the island known as East Potomac Park as well.

Although the Anacostia River did not flood as badly, Congress was convinced that it needed dredging, too.  Partly, this was because the Washington Navy Yard was just upstream from where the Anacostia met the Potomac, and navy ships needed a deeper channel.  Congress also wanted much more economic development in Anacostia, and felt that a deeper channel would enable the development of wharves and piers and a thriving heavy-industry sector there.

Dredging of the Anacostia also generated a lot of silt and fill, and this was used to build up the shoreline to get rid of wetlands (which were mistakenly believed to be full of sewage and causing disease).

The Corps placed riprap walls along the new shorelines of both rivers to prevent erosion of the embankments.  

These walls have been collapsing ever since, and little work is done to maintain them.",[],collapsing riprap wall - Anacostia River - 11th Street Bridges - 2013-09-17,Attribution-ShareAlike License,23165290@N00,jpg,,10860730194,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/,1384467607,2013-09-17 15:47:36.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/23165290@N00/10860730194/,Tim Evanson,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D7100

"Founded by two Scottish merchants, the Thistle Cotton Mill was operating by 1824, according to Baltimore County historian John W. McGrain. The thistle, a name used for various prickly plants, is Scotland's national emblem.

In its 19th century heyday and even well into this century, the community had 30 to 40 houses, and at times as many as 500 workers produced cotton and silk fabric and thread at the mill.

In his book, ""The Patapsco, Baltimore's River of History,"" Maryland Park Ranger Paul Travers described Thistle as ""resembling a typical village in northern Wales.""

The roads are narrow, and stone cottages with walls nearly 18 inches thick line the riverbank and the hillside.

The oldest buildings, sturdy tenements beside the river and duplex cottages above, were of locally quarried granite.

Later dwellings farther up the hill were of frame construction.

Today, six houses remain. And 110 employees -- only a few of whom live in Thistle -- process recycled wastepaper into box board, according to the plant's general manager, Les Deutsch, who has a long view of the valley from his hillside home.

The fire-ravaged shell of a four-story stone house -- the last riverbank dwelling -- stands opposite the mill.

While so much has changed, the half-dozen dwellings still clinging to thehillside are reminders of Thistle's past.

The village housed generations of millworkers who began producing cotton goods in the 1820s. Over the years, ownership changed and production shifted to silk fabric and thread, then back to cotton.

In 1928, production switched to paper and cardboard, which continues today.

Although dozens of tractor-trailers rumble in and out daily hauling recycled wastepaper, Thistle nestles on its hillside in obscurity.

""If you don't know it's here, you won't find it,"" said Robert N. Frey Jr., 41, the plant controller, who grew up in the area.

""Most of my friends were here,"" Mr. Frey said. ""We had a lot of cousins. . . . We played in the woods and we dammed a stream for swimming. The water is a lot cleaner now than it was when we were kids.""

Fire, flood and demolition have taken their toll on the old buildings. But 69-year-old Samuel Shifflett of Sykesville, who spent 44 years in Thistle, remembers it as ""beautiful.""

""The whole hill was in green grass that was kept well cut. All the houses were kept painted, and the maintenance crew looked afterthem. It was just beautiful,"" he said.

Some buildings were razed in the 1940s, and the mill owners let county firefighters burn eight houses for practice, he said.

Betty Gibson, 55, arrived in Thistle at the age of 2 when her stepfather began his 36-year career as a millworker. She has spent most of her life here. The family lived in a company house on winding Hilltop Road, but only the front steps remain.

The family moved later to a stone house nearer the valley. Mrs. Gibson still lives there with her son and grandson.

""All the houses were here when we came,"" Mrs. Gibson recalled. ""There were no parking lots then.""

Ruins of what might have been the village's church and school stand beside Thistle Road. On the ridge above, overgrown by trees and bushes, is the old graveyard. Many gravestones have been vandalized and others have been weathered into illegibility. The legible markers show dates from the 1830s to 1928.

The threat of flooding during severe storms hangs over the valley, and Thistle has suffered over the years like other mill villages along the river.

But unlike the others, which have disappeared, it has always rebounded.

Mrs. Gibson recalled Hurricane Agnes' devastation in 1972: ""It was scary. The roar of the water sounded like the mill was still running.

""We watched houses float downriver, and the original catwalk [which provided access to the power plant across the river] washed out. When the water receded, there was a man's body entangled in the wreckage of the catwalk.""

The plant was recovering from the $1 million storm damage when a four-alarm fire erupted in November 1972, she said.

The plant was rebuilt within the ruins, work resumed and, once again, Thistle fought back, Mrs. Gibson said.

Melvin Shifflett, 48, grew up in Thistle during his father's career at the mill and worked there himself until 1981, when he started a paper recycling company.","['abandoned', 'college', 'd90', 'decay', 'ilchester', 'lost film', ""mary's"", 'maryland', 'nikon', 'park', 'patapsco', 'river', 'ruins', 'st', 'state', 'urbex']",Thistle Mill - Ilchester Maryland [Abandoned],Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,30690694@N05,jpg,-76.765494,9378337819,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1374964700,2013-07-26 11:34:24.0,39.251896,http://www.flickr.com/photos/30690694@N05/9378337819/,Jack Says Relax,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D90

"Erto e Casso (PN, Friuli Venezia Giulia, Italy)

<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gL7BJWIy2I"" rel=""nofollow"">Fantasmi di pietra</a>

On 9 October 1963 at 10:39 PM, a landslide of about 260 million m³ of forest, earth, and rock fell into the reservoir created by the Vajont Dam (still one of the highest concrete dams in the world, in Belluno province) at up to 110 km per hour (68 mph). The resulting displacement of water caused 50 million m³ of water to over-top the dam in a 250 m high wave. Despite this, the dam's structure was largely undamaged.

The flooding in the Piave valley destroyed the villages of Longarone, Pirago, Rivalta, Villanova and Faè, killing around 2000 people and turning the land below into a flat plain of mud. Many small villages in the territory of Erto e Casso and the village of Codissago were largely wrecked. Estimates of the dead range from 1900 to 2500 people, and about 350 families lost all members. Most of the survivors had lost relatives and friends along with their homes and belongings.

Immediately after the flood, governement and most of the italian newspapers depicted the tragedy as an unexpected and unavoidable natural event and marked as jackals journalists and politicians who dared to say that the landslide was largely predictable. But soon enough it was clear that governement, dam builders and owners (energy producers and providers) and engineers purposely ignored irrefutable proofs of the great instability of Mount Toc (which name means in local dialect “crumbling”).

Most of the survivors were moved into a newly built village, Vajont, 50 km south east on the river Tagliamento plain. Those who insisted on returning to their mountain life in Erto e Casso were strongly discouraged. Longarone and other villages in the Piave valley were rebuilt with modern houses and factories.","['abandoned', 'abbandonato', 'ante', 'casa', 'desert', 'deserto', 'erto', 'finestra', 'friuli', 'home', 'italia', 'italy', 'montagna', 'mountain', 'old', 'paese', 'pietra', 'port', 'porta', 'remains', 'resti', 'silence', 'silenzio', 'solitude', 'solitudine', 'stone', 'town', 'vajont', 'valcellina', 'vecchio', 'village', 'villaggio', 'window']",Erto,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,43864888@N03,jpg,,6041092587,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1313326372,2011-08-13 13:00:51.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/43864888@N03/6041092587/,Giulia van Pelt,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D3100

"Vigil held by the London Guantánamo Campaign (LGC) & the Save Shaker Aamer Campaign (SSAC) outside the assemble of New Scotland Yard building in London,15 August 2013.

'TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT SHAKER AAMER' was a noisy protest intended to draw attention to the lack of information from the Metropolitan Police following their investigation into Shaker Aamer’s allegations that he was tortured in Afghanistan in 2001 and 2002 in the presence of British intelligence Officers. Three years ago, the Director of Public Prosecutions asked New Scotland Yard to report on these allegations. SSAC believes that the investigation was intentionally delayed to prevent public knowledge of wrong-doing by Government secret agents. Eventually, earlier this year, the metropolitan Police interviewed Shaker Aamer in Guantanamo. They were there for three days and took 120 pages of notes. Since then, there has been silence.

LGC & SSAC also delivered a letter to the Commissioner of Police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe.","['#closeguantanamo', '#demandaccountability4crimesagaitshumanity', '#endndaa', '#endtorture', '#freeshakeraamer!', '#opgtmo', '#saveshakeraamer']","""TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT SHAKER AAMER""",Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,88820961@N05,jpg,,9524011725,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1376685869,2013-08-15 00:00:10.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/88820961@N05/9524011725/,ReclaimJustice,Nokia 800

"Flushing Airport is a decommissioned airfield in northern Queens in New York City. It is located in the neighborhood of College Point, near Flushing. The airfield was in operation from 1927 to 1984. It was originally called Speed's Airport and was one of the busiest airports in New York City before the emergence of the larger LaGuardia Airport. In the early 1970s a skywriting company operated there. In 1977, a Piper Twin Comanche crashed shortly after taking off, killing those on board. The incident, along with frequent flooding, led to the closing of this airport in 1984.

"It’s lights out for Dynamo in L.A.
Quest for 3rd MLS Cup ends with extra-time collapse
By JOSE DE JESUS ORTIZ Copyright 2009 Houston Chronicle
Nov. 14, 2009, 3:07AM

CARSON, Calif. -- It took extra time, but David Beckham, Landon Donovan, Gregg Berhalter and the rest of the Los Angeles Galaxy finally put the lights out for good on the Dynamo in the Western Conference final.

The Galaxy, who began the season with Donovan and Beckham needing to repair their  fractured relationship, beat the Dynamo 2-0 to win the Western Conference title Friday night and clinch a berth in the MLS Cup.

The Dynamo’s hopes began to fade shortly after referee Terry Vaughn called Ricardo Clark for a foul on Jovan Kirovski in the 103rd minute. Beckham took the free kick from about 38 yards and found Omar Gonzalez, who headed it toward the goal from inside the 6-yard box.

Eddie Robinson, who had replaced Brad Davis in the 96th minute, stepped in front of Gonzalez’s header and kicked it a few yards up. Fortunately for the Galaxy, Berhalter found the rebound and pushed it into the right side of the net from about 12 yards while falling back for the 1-0 lead.

""I was just ready to put my body on the line,"" Gonzalez said. ""I just had to get my head on it. All year, I haven’t really gotten that many headers. Time was running down, and I just had to get my head on it. It just happened to come off a Dynamo player, and Gregg was right there to finish it off. Beckham put a great ball in there.""

Clark’s problems continued in the 108th minute, when he was called for a penalty for tripping Alan Gordon inside the Dynamo’s 18-yard box. Donovan converted the penalty kick and ran toward the right side, where Beckham sprinted toward him as both stars began to run in an embrace.

""I thought the foul that led to the set piece in their goal was kind of soft based on the previous calls that he’d been making,"" Clark said. ""I don’t think there were consistent with that at all. I think that cost us the game. I think it’s fair to call the penalty, but I don’t think the first call.”

The game before a crowd of 25,373 at the Home Depot Center was marred by 18-minute delays in the first and second halves, prompting several Dynamo players to say the power failures were ""unprofessional.""

With the contest scoreless after regulation, the game went into two 15-minute extra-time periods.

The Galaxy will next face the winner of today's Eastern Conference Final between the Chicago Fire and Real Salt Lake in the MLS Cup final Nov. 22 in Seattle.

The Dynamo, who won the MLS Cup in 2006 and 2007 in their first two seasons in Houston after arriving from San Jose, Calif., got off to a sluggish start as the Galaxy threatened over the first eight minutes of the match.

The Dynamo then began to control the pace until the teams and fans were stunned by the first delay. In the 18th minute, the flood lights went off to bring the action to a halt.

""I thought we were doing OK until the lights went out,"" Dynamo coach Dominic Kinnear said. ""The momentum kind of swung a little bit after that.""

Five minutes into the second half, the lights went out again to force another stoppage.

""The loss in stadium lights during the match was due to two significant power dips in Southern California Edison Industrial grid in which the facility sits,"" read a statement from the Home Depot Center. ""Any time the facility experiences a power dip on the network, emergency event lights are activated and the stadium lights immediately reset, which takes approximately 20 minutes to illuminate to full capacity for the event to resume.""

In the 24th minute, Brian Mullan drew a yellow card for fouling Edson Buddle about 30 yards out to force a free kick that was taken by Beckham.

Dynamo goalkeeper Pat Onstad, 41, made a sensational save in the 25th minute when he dived and punched out a brilliant free kick that Beckham sent toward the right corner. As Stuart Holden sprinted down the left side in the 77th minute, Dema Kovalenko tripped him and drew a yellow card.

Brian Ching almost gave the Dynamo the lead in the 78th minute from 8 yards out when he masterfully headed Mullan's cross toward keeper Donovan Ricketts, who made a sensational leap to push the ball over the crossbar to force a corner kick.

In the ensuing corner kick, Andrew Hainault sent a scare through the Galaxy by heading a corner kick into the net, but Vaughn called a foul on Luis Angel Landin over A.J. DeLaGarza on the play, and the goal was disallowed.

""I’d like to see a replay of our goal,"" Kinnear said. ""If you’re going to call a foul on that, you can pretty much call a foul on every set piece that’s been in Major League Soccer this year because there was a fair amount of contact.""

"From <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humpback_Covered_Bridge"" target=""_blank"">Wikipedia</a>:

The Humpback Covered Bridge located in the U.S. state of Virginia, is one of the only remaining covered bridges in the United States that was built higher in the middle than on either end; hence the name of ""humpback"". The bridge was built in 1857 and is also the oldest remaining covered bridge in the state of Virginia. Its WGCB number is 46-03-01. The bridge spans a tributary of the Jackson River known as Dunlap Creek, for a distance of 109 feet (33 m). The humpback feature is 4 feet (1.2 m) higher in the center than at either end. The bridge is located near the city of Covington, Virginia.

Three bridges stood at approximately the same location as Humpback Covered Bridge does today. The first bridge was built in the 1820s and was destroyed by a flood in 1837. A second bridge built the next year was also damaged beyond repair by a flood on July 13, 1842. The third bridge collapsed in 1856 due to heavy use and fatigue from weathering. None of these earlier bridges were either arched or covered. All three bridges were a part of the James River and Kanawha Turnpike, a heavily used mountain road that connected the Shenandoah Valley with the Alleghany Mountains and areas further west. The current bridge was built in 1857 and the design of both covering and also arching the bridge was hoped to increase the longevity of the bridge by protecting the midsection from future floods and the decking from the ravaging effects of moisture and sunlight.

The Humpback Covered Bridge was used from 1857 to 1929, when a steel truss bridge was built for U.S. Highway 60 immediately to the north. The bridge was abandoned but was sometimes used by a local farmer into the early 1950s to store hay bales. In 1953, the Virginia Highway Department matched a $5,000 fund that had been raised by the Covington Business and Professional Women's Club and the Covington Chamber of Commerce. Five acres surrounding the bridge were purchased and a small wayside park which opened in 1954 was built, allowing easier access. On October 1, 1969, the bridge was listed in the National Register of Historic Places.

Most covered bridges were made of the strongest readily available wood. In the case of the Humpback Covered Bridge, this meant white oak and hickory. The bridge, as it stands today, has most of the original hand-hewn support timbers and decking that was laid down in 1857, however, most of the walls and roofing have been replaced several times since. Bridge decking was traditionally constructed of wide planks a foot (30.5 cm) or more in width and 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) in thickness. Most of the support beams are at least a foot thick (30.5 cm). The supports in the bridge utilized hand made honey locust wood pins to fasten sections of the supports together. The supports incorporate a unique curved multiple kingpost-truss system that is not found in any other surviving wooden bridge in the U.S. The bridge is an original and completely unique design not duplicated anywhere else.

"Das Golmer Luch ist eine Sumpflandschaft westlich und südlich von Potsdam-Golm.
Bereits im 17. Jahrhundert kamen holländische Kolonisten nach Brandneburg, die auch hier um Potsdam bei der Trockenlegung mitwirkten.
Der ca. 6 km lange Deich zwischen Marquardt und Golm dient auch heute noch dem Hochwasserschutz im Bereich der Havel- bzw. Wublitzseen (Schlänitzsee, Großer Zernsee).
""In den letzten Jahren sei die Gegend östlich von Zernsee und Wublitz zwar von Hochwasser verschont geblieben, aber eines Tages könnte das „böse Erwachen“ kommen, so Paul. Dann könnte das Wasser bei schadhaften Deichen sogar den Ortsteil Eiche gefährden. Havel und Spree mit ihren Seen und Nebenflüssen sind wie ein System zusammenhängender Röhren miteinander verbunden. Momentan würde durch das „Volllaufen“ der Tagebaue noch viel Wasser abgefangen. Wenn das aber wegfalle, könnte das Brandenburger Wehr, das „ein Glück für Potsdam“ sei, die Wassermassen in akuten Hochwasserzeiten nicht mehr stoppen.""

"somewhere in Illinois, a couple of hours before we hit Indiana.

We'd just driven through a seriously dark storm with multispeed, multilayered clouds twisting and turning into something with an ominous look to it.  Just after I snapped this photo (and a couple of others) we found a radio station giving a current weather update.

The update?  50 or so miles away there <i>had</i> been a tornado touchdown.  The winds were gusting at 60mph, and it was going to be crappy before it got better.  

KD and I both were relieved that the direction in which we were traveling happened <i>not</i> to be the same direction in which the storm was going.

We happened by this tipped-over semi just after it had tipped - an ambulance was on the scene but police had not yet arrived.  We wished safe thoughts toward the driver, continuing on our way.

*image was lightened greatly or none of us would have been able to figure out what was beyond the pickup truck.","['highway', 'on the road', 'semi', 'storm', 'strong winds', 'tipped over', 'truck', 'vehicular accident']",truck tip-over,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,48889090149@N01,jpg,,431004364,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1174619327,2007-03-14 16:43:45.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/48889090149@N01/431004364/,McBeth,Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XT

Our lives seemed to be lived in between blurry nights and bleary days, with varying degrees of sobriety. The number of memories that you lose into the depths of your consciousness when each night blurs into one big congealed mass is bewildering. 

Each time has its own intricacies and differences, but if you asked what happened when or where, then you can forget it.

I wonder how many memories we have stored away that just need a bit of prompting to come flooding back - millions?

"A flash flood on 16 August 2004, caused extensive damage to the village. Residents were trapped in houses as the roads turned into rivers: people were trapped on roofs, in cars, in buildings and on the rivers' banks and the village's visitor centre was washed away.

Around 50 cars were swept into the harbour and the bridge was washed away, roads were submerged under 2.75 m of water, this made communication very difficult for the citizens of Boscastle. The sewerage system burst and due to the health and safety reasons Boscastle was declared inaccessible.

"Days of torrential rain last week produced floods throughout Minn. and Wis., I got to see some of the results as the crest flowed down the Minnesota river valley. I'm struck by this quiet, relentless power that swallows fields, roads and whole buildings with equal disregard, laying waste to what was a spectacular farm season on the very eve of harvest.

Some friends of Ed's, with this place on the river, just about finished cleaning from the spring floods. On the up side, they spent time this summer building a berm around their house, so it at least remains dry.","['barn', 'corn', 'fall', 'farm', 'flood', 'minnesota river', 'mn', 'rural']",barn or boathouse,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,44978217@N00,jpg,,5038735869,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1285860100,2010-09-29 13:10:33.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/44978217@N00/5038735869/,Azure Bleu,Panasonic DMC-FZ50

"If you look carefully as you hike along the Wild Loop, you can see rock that dates back to the Triassic Period – gypsum. This white, porous rock is composed of the remains of aquatic creatures that lived in Colorado’s inland sea more than 206 million years ago. Besides being an amazing piece of northern Colorado’s ancient past, gypsum also played a role in the region’s more recent history. From the beginning of the 20th century to the 1960s, gypsum was the key ingredient in both making plaster and building the local community that mined the gypsum beds. While digging the gypsum, local miners also found fossils embedded within the rock, including a prehistoric elephant with 5-foot long tusks.

In 1878, Aaron Benson, a native of Louden, Iowa moved to the Big Thompson Valley from Golden, Colorado. Around 1888, Benson built an irrigation ditch (the main Louden Ditch) that cut through the southern end of the Devil’s Backbone, and originally serviced 12,000 acres of farmland. During construction of the Louden Ditch around the south end of the Devil’s Backbone, workers struck a soft, white material. Gypsum is a mineral most often used in the manufacture of plaster of Paris, various other plaster products, and fertilizers. Gypsum was mined in Hidden Valley from 1887 until 1965 when a flood on Buckhorn Creek destroyed it.","['colorado', ""devil's backbone open spaces"", 'geology', 'gypsum', 'hogback', 'larimer county', 'mining', 'rock formations']",Old Gypsum Mill,Attribution-NoDerivs License,59429971@N06,jpg,-105.149631,6190560172,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/,1317166112,2011-05-23 16:33:20.0,40.409444,http://www.flickr.com/photos/59429971@N06/6190560172/,warriorwoman531,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D5000

"This ""before"" shot shows the extra wide apron that we have decided to take advantage of with our new driveway. The angle of the apron is gentler where the driveway is going versus where it is. The exhaust on the Audi liked to drag when we had the car loaded down. Soon we will no longer have that problem either once the new driveway is in place.

We decided our next major house project was to redo our driveway. It has been terrible since we bought the house. 2/3 destroyed blacktop & 1/3 sunken concrete that made for a flooding hazard during the rain. Weeds all over, hard to shovel or snowplow. No fun for bikes or toys for the children. Tripping hazard for everyone. We actually decided to redo it a while ago but other things came first. We would have made it straight since we didn't own the backyard yet. But the two big pine trees were in the way. We didn't want to have a new driveway get destroyed by tree roots like the old one did so we waited. Then after we able to purchase the backyard, the driveway came to the top of the list. We prepared by cutting down the two pine trees & grinding up the stumps. We had contacted the local companies that do driveways & got quotes. A long & frustrating process that was. Then a friend recommended Gilson Construction. Turns out I know the owner from my time as a Service Advisor @ Bergstrom & Witt. They came back with an affordable bid & had no issues with our project. They were great to work with & accommodated all our requests. We have no qualms recommending them ourselves. We now have an amazing driveway that has no more flooding issues, will be easy to shovel, & the kids just love to play on. Totally worth it.","['100cs', 'audi', 'concrete', 'construction', 'driveway', 'gilson', 'new', 'project']",DSC_3651,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,84424736@N00,jpg,-87.378022,10255997094,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1381701075,2013-07-28 18:00:33.0,44.842009,http://www.flickr.com/photos/84424736@N00/10255997094/,150hp,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D70s

"From the early 1920s until 1944, a hydroelectric plant operated on the Falling Water River. This dam was constructed in 1928-1929, replacing the first one which was damaged by a flood. Their purpose was to provide a reliable reservoir of water to operate a turbine in the plant located a short distance downstream from the Big Falls. In early times a bridge crossed the river a very short distance below the dam. When the 1928 dam was built (on the same foundations as the first dam), the roadway was put across it. It carried traffic until 1987 when Hwy 135 traffic was diverted to the new bridge upstream. The small motor sitting atop the dam was pushed by hand along the track and was used to open and close the steel spillway gates.","['bridge', 'burgess falls', 'closed', 'county', 'd40', 'dam', 'falling water', 'gears', 'motor', 'nikon', 'putnam', 'rails', 'river', 'rust', 'state park', 'tennessee']",Burgess Falls Dam,Attribution License,66335021@N00,jpg,-85.593425,3359158796,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1237178692,2009-03-15 11:58:22.0,36.044121,http://www.flickr.com/photos/66335021@N00/3359158796/,somegeekintn,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D40

"Tropical Storm Fay's effects on Brevard county, Florida. This is in Windover Farms. Channel 6 just reported that Windover Farms recorded a historic 24  inches of rain. There's normally some water here, but also normally a lot of dry land. It looks like a major waterway now. 

The total for TS Fay at Windover Farms is now 26.65 inches for the 72 hours ending 6AM 8/22/08. To put this in perspective, consider:  The record daily rainfall for Melbourne (airport) for August is 9.06 inches, set in 1995. 

The wettest <i>month</i> ever in Melbourne before this was August 1948 with 20.23 inches.

Although we received these torrential rains, I'm not aware of any homes in Windover Farms of Melbourne that flooded due to tropical storm Fay. Homes were apparently built far enough up according to building codes to stay dry. The building codes worked as intended! This is not a particularly low-lying area.

Traffic in front of City Hall was fairly heavy, and I had to stand and wait for several minutes to get this clear photo of the building.","['coahuila', 'coahuila de zaragoza', 'mexico', 'piedras negras']",Piedras Negras City Hall,Attribution-NonCommercial License,83372564@N00,jpg,-100.514345,3007236669,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1225977124,2005-02-01 00:00:00.0,28.706059,http://www.flickr.com/photos/83372564@N00/3007236669/,J.

"I happened to notice this epic moustache while waiting at the Lincoln bus stop. Striking up a conversation, Dave happily allowed me to shoot his facial hair. Turns out he works at the Chicago Metro and we knew a few of the same people. In fact, he is a hobby photographer who still shoots film and is ALSO a Flickr member. 

Thanks, Dave!

"Reaching out to the Flickr community to help bring some joy to a 5 year old cancer patient.  Just a lil' postcard will do.  :)

Saw this post on the Disboards....

""Dear all-
I recently had the honor and privilege to meet a young man by the name of Wes Pak. Wes is 5 years old and has been diagnosed with Stage 4 Neuroblastoma Cancer. Wes is a wonderful kid who LOVES getting mail. I asked his mom if it would be ok to put a call to post cards to my Disney family in hopes of flooding Wes with postcards, after warning her, there are a LOT of us and we do LOVE helping others. Her words ""Bring it On!"" Please help me by taking a moment to send a card to Wes. They don't have to be Disney postcards, local postcards, hand drawn cards etc would be awesome. I just want to make sure this little guy is getting a USPS Delivered smile on his face.
If you are interested please send a 5 year old friendly card and message to Wes Pak 114 Shrewsbury Square Yorktown, VA 23692

And if you can please share this plan with your friends and family and church groups I would truly appreciate it!!""

"""Two-Gun"" Louis Alterie (aka ""Diamond Jack"") and his wife moved into this apartment building in 1935. Louis was a small time racketeer who was the leader of the Theatrical Janitors Union Local 25, a position he held because of his ties with Dean O'Banion's North Side gang. At this time prohibition had been repealed and the mobs were looking to find new work for their henchmen.

Louie's wife Erma had received a phone call from a stranger who said ""the Angel of Death will call on you unless you get out. The syndicate wants the union."" Soon afterward, on July 18, Louie was gunned down in front of this building by shots fired from 927 W. Eastwood. Eleven bullets hit him in the chest and head. ""Honey, I guess I'm through!"" he told his wife as he lay on the street. He died in hospital a half hour later.

"Over two weeks spent in Europe, including three countries in which I conducted serious tourism, two which I buzzed through on the way to somewhere else, and two more that I waved at over mountain passes, the thing I fell most in love with is Lange Erlen park, in Kleinbasel, on the German border.

Like the numerous fountains of Basel, it made me miss my huskies terribly. The river Wiese is exactly the sort of swimming spot they love best.

"The fourth priority area of the Hyogo Framework for Action – addressing underlying drivers of disaster risk – has proved the most challenging area of implementation for countries around the world. 

An innovative Norwegian development shows what can be done with good vision, planning, implementation and ongoing commitment to investing today for a safer tomorrow.

On the site of the former Oslo airport an eco-friendly mixed development is transforming a polluted post-industrial wasteland into an area of parkland, residences and offices that is flood-resilient.

Here, UNISDR goes on a tour of the Fornebu development with landscape architect Simen Gylseth that once completed will host 6,000 residents and 20,000 office and light industrial workers in developments arranged around parkland of 200,000 square metres.

The field trip is part of the European Forum for Disaster Risk Reduction (EFDRR) being held in Oslo and hosted by the Norwegian Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning, the Chair of the EFDRR. The meeting is co-organized in collaboration with the Council of Europe (EUR-OPA) and UNISDR Europe.

"This was  taken during the islamic celebrations of Muharram festival in Jaipur, in the old city. 
Thousands of poeple (probably a hundred thousand or so) flood old Jaipur for the islamic Muharram celebration, mourning for the martyrdom of Hazrat Imam Hussein. Most of them are playing drums, shouting, singing and carrying tazias, glittering replicas of the Imam Hussein's tomb from small ones (like the one in the picture) to huge ones. The sound and confusion are incredible. 

For some reason this was left out of my 'India 2008' set. It's not a perfect photo. Some people are blurred, the composition is not perfect and the trees in the left-top corner are 'burned' by the light...

BUT it was taken into a huge crowd where I was the only westerner.

"Art Deco was the hot architectural style in America during the 1920s and 1930s. The style is characterized by features like smooth wall surfaces (often shiny metal), with zigzags, chevrons, and other geometric motifs as decorative elements on the façade. The geometric motifs usually emphasize verticality, which is often enhanced by adding towers and vertical projections. Even figure sculptures display an angular geometric approach. One of the best examples of Art Deco style in New York State, and arguably in America, is the Niagara Mohawk Building in Syracuse. This dramatic seven-story structure, which is the headquarters of the Niagara Mohawk Power Company at 300 Erie Boulevard West, was built in 1932. It was designed by the Buffalo architectural firm of Bley & Lyman and the Syracuse architect Melvin L. King. The façade is constructed of gray brick and stone in a series of setbacks, with additional cladding in stainless steel, aluminum, and black glass. The ornamentation is truly opulent. There are parallel bands, zigzags, and chevrons. At the base of the tower six stories above the entrance, there is a 28-foot-high statue of a male figure with outstretched arms from which rays of light emanate like giant wings. The stunning sculpture is called, “Spirit of Light.” Niagara Mohawk gleams, shimmering in daylight and glittering at night with interior lighting and powerful exterior flood illumination.
The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in June, 2010.[1] The listing was announced as the featured listing in the National Park Service's weekly list of June 25, 2010.[4]
The building was built in 1932. It was headquarters for what was ""then the nation's largest electric utility company"".[5]
It was nominated by New York State's Board of Historic Preservation for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in December, 2009. The Board described the building as ""'an outstanding example of Art Deco architecture and a symbol of the Age of Electricity.

This bridge is almost a century old (it is rather narrow and fits only two lanes of dangerously-close traffic), yet has survived all the major floods and earthquakes that have struck this area.

This photo would be better if I had set the focus manually on the bridge and had used a tripod; as it was early evening, I had to use a long exposure to get a sufficiently bright picture, and some blurriness from twitching the camera is evident. Oh well; a lesson for next time.","['bridge', 'california', 'cement', 'fernbridge', 'ferndale', 'fortuna', 'humboldt']",Fernbridge,Attribution License,55733754@N00,jpg,-124.204462,3261331731,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1234059711,2009-02-07 18:21:51.0,40.611187,http://www.flickr.com/photos/55733754@N00/3261331731/,Garrett Albright,

"Trim Castle (Baile Atha Troim in Irish), Trim, County Meath, Ireland has an area of 30,000 m². It is the remains of the largest Norman castle in Europe. It was built primarily by Hugh de Lacy and his son Walter.

The central three-story building, called a keep, donjon or great tower, is unique in its design, being of cruciform shape, with twenty corners. It was built in at least three stages, initially by Hugh de Lacy (c.1174) and then in 1196 and 1206 by Walter de Lacy. The keep was built on the site of a previous wooden fortification that was burnt down in 1173, following attacks by the Gaelic King of Connacht, Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair.

The surviving curtain walls are predominantly of mid-13th century origin on the Dublin and Town Side, while on the River side, are almost completely destroyed.

Other building within the castle grounds include a very unusual circular barbican gate in the curtain walls, serving as the Dublin gate, a square gate house on the town side, called the Trim Gate, the outline of a mid-13th century great hall, and a mint.

The Castle was used as a centre of Norman administration for the Liberty of Meath, one of the newly created administrative areas of Ireland, created by Henry II of England and granted to Hugh de Lacy. He took possession of it in 1172, and would originally have appeared to have chosen the sea port of Drogheda as his caput. However, in 1174, following the destruction of the original castle, the newly refurbished castle was chosen for this purpose.

The castle site was chosen because it is on raised ground, overlooking a fording point over the River Boyne, and although the site is about 25 miles from the Irish Sea, it was accessible in medieval times by boat up the River Boyne.

During the late Middle Ages, Trim Castle was the centre of administration for Meath and demarcated the outer boundary of The Pale. In the 16th and 17th centuries it had declined in importance, except as an important military site. After the Cromwellian wars, the castle grounds were granted to the Wellington family who held it until the time of Arthur Wellesley, who sold it. In following years it passed into the hands of the Plunkett family, who held it until the 1993, when the state bought the Castle and began conservation and archaeological works on it.

The Castle is noted for the part it played in the filming of the Mel Gibson directed film Braveheart.

Trim Castle is open to the public everyday from Easter Saturday to Halloween (October 31st) from 10am, with first tour at 10.30am, last entry at 5pm and last tour at 5.15pm. In winter it is open only on weekends and bank holidays.

In the early 2000s the Irish Environment Minister, Martin Cullen, ordered his officials not to oppose the erection of a controversial five-story hotel beside the castle. His actions were condemned by planners, officials and heritage bodies, many of whom had been critical of his government's treatment of other heritage sites such as Carrickmines Castle (which was bulldozed to allow the completion of a roadway) and Carton House, which had its house turned into a hotel and its eighteenth century grounds turned into two golf courses. The hotel, which is very close to Trim Castle, was completed in August 2006.","['boyne', 'dublin city', 'dublin guide', 'guide to dublin', 'infomatique', 'ireland', 'magical murphy', 'magical murphy the virtual tourist guide', 'mapireland', 'meath', 'norman', 'norman castle', 'photographs', 'tourist guide', 'trim', 'trim castle', 'visit dublin', 'william murphy', 'www.infomatique.org']","TRIM CASTLE - COUNTY MEATH, IRELAND",Attribution-ShareAlike License,80824546@N00,jpg,-6.790151,336555087,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/,1167338962,2006-12-25 21:46:21.0,53.558461,http://www.flickr.com/photos/80824546@N00/336555087/,infomatique,Canon EOS 5D

"Records of a church on this spot go back to the 12th century. It is built on a slight hill (terp in Dutch), to keep it dry when there was a flood. Most of the church was rebuilt in the early 19th century, but a piece of the tower is still original.

The village Foudgum is famous because the Dutch 19th century writer and poet François Haverschmidt was a minister there from 1859 to 1862. The difference between his student days in Leiden and this rural village with more conservative attitudes could not be greater. 
Foudgum has since decided to honour Haverschmidt by naming several streets after him and placing a monument in front of the church.","['church', 'foudgum', 'françois haverschmidt', 'friesland', 'haverschmidt', 'kerk', 'kirk', 'nederland', 'netherlands', 'piet paaltjens']",Foudgum in Friesland: Church,Attribution License,39839593@N00,jpg,5.94179,2913291712,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1223155645,2008-10-03 14:23:46.0,53.345376,http://www.flickr.com/photos/39839593@N00/2913291712/,Michiel2005,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D80

"Just as the sun was setting I decided to go out for a quick drive to see if I could find some strange formation's called the Hoodoo's. I knew they were near Columbia Lake but had no idea that they were literally two minutes drive from the resort we are staying at. 

I was looking on the Internet trying to find out where the Hoodoo's were located and in the end gave up and just went for a drive, knowing that they were somewhere near Columbia Lake. Here are the directions. Drive south on the 95 from Fairmont Hot Springs. As you drive over a metal bridge look behind you. If you are driving north on the 95 towards Fairmont they are at the Northern tip of Columbia lake. If you get as far as the signs for the Fairmont Hot Springs resort and haven't seen them, I recommend a trip to the opticians!

All I know about the Hoodoo's at the moment is that they are created by erosion, and are linked to a myth about a huge fish swimming down the COlumbia valley and getting stuck. It's decomposing body left its ribs which are the Hoodoo's.

This is the view of the Dutch Creek Bridge with the Hoodoo's rising behind. What you don't see are the ridiculous amounts of midges that were munching on my legs, arms, face, nose and any other exposed skin they could find.

"""Verona is a city in Veneto, northern Italy, one of the seven provincial capitals in the region. It is one of the main tourist destinations in north-eastern Italy, thanks to its artistic heritage, several annual fairs, shows and operas, such as the lyrical season in the Arena, the ancient amphitheatre built by the Romans.
Verona owes its historical and economical importance to its geographical location, in a loop of the Adige River near Lake Garda. Because of this position, the areas saw regular floodings until 1956, when the Mori-Torbole tunnel was constructed, providing 500 cubic meters of discharge from the Adige river to Lake Garda when there was danger of flooding. The tunnel reduced the risk of flooding from once every seventy years to once every two centuries.

"O rio Paraná ('como o mar' ou 'parecido com o mar', do tupi para (mar) e na (se parece com ou como) é um rio sul-americano que nasce entre os estados de São Paulo, Minas Gerais e Mato Grosso do Sul, no Brasil, na confluência de dois importantes rios brasileiros: o Rio Grande e Paranaíba. O Rio Paraná corre aproximadamente no eixo central da Bacia do Paraná, uma ampla bacia sedimentar.
 
Em seu percurso, banha também o estado do Paraná, adquirindo uma extensão total de 3.998 km, que lhe renderia o posto de o nono rio mais extenso do mundo, caso fosse contado o trecho do rio Paranaíba. O rio Paraná demarca a fronteira entre Brasil e Paraguai numa extensão de 190 km até à foz do rio Iguaçu.
 
A partir de Foz do Iguaçu, o rio muda para direção oeste e passa a ser o limite natural entre Argentina e Paraguai. Na confluência do rio Paraguai o rio entra inteiramente em terras argentinas e passa a percorrer a direção sul, desaguando no delta do Paraná e, conseqüentemente, no Rio da Prata.
 
A sua vazão na foz, de 16.000 m³/s, é comparável à de rios como o rio Mississippi (18.000 m³/s) e o rio Ganges(16.000 m³/s).
 
No trecho brasileiro há a barragem de Jupiá, que está localizada a 21 quilômetros da confluência com o rio Tietê, assim como também a barragem de Ilha Solteira, enquanto na fronteira do Paraguai com o Brasil está a usina-barragem de Itaipu, e na fronteira entre a Argentina e o Paraguai, Yacyretá. As duas hidroelétricas fornecem 99% da eletricidade do Paraguai (90% só de Itaipú), e fazem do país o maior exportador de eletricidade do mundo.
 
A floresta tropical e subtropical que antes ocupava boa parte da bacia do Paraná encontra-se largamente extinta; a área mais preservada encontra-se na província argentina de Misiones.
----------------------
El Paraná es un río de América del Sur que atraviesa la mitad sur del subcontinente y forma parte de la extensa cuenca combinada del Plata.
 
Esta cuenca recoge las aguas de la mayoría de los ríos del sur del subcontinente, como el Paraná, el Paraguay, el Uruguay, sus afluentes y diversos humedales, como el Pantanal, los Esteros del Ibera y el Bañado la Estrella . Es la segunda cuenca más extensa de Sudamérica, sólo superada por la del río Amazonas.
 
La unión de los ríos Paraná y Uruguay forman el estuario denominado Río de la Plata, donde el Paraná desemboca en un delta en constante crecimiento, producto de los sedimentos que aportan, principalmente, los ríos Paraguay y Bermejo.
 
Paraná es el apócope de la expresión ""para rehe onáva"" que en idioma guaraní significa ""pariente del mar"" o ""agua que se mezcla con el mar"".
=============
The Paraná River (Spanish: Río Paraná, Portuguese: Rio Paraná) is a river in south Central South America, running through Brazil, Paraguay and Argentina for some 4,880 kilometres (3,030 mi).[2] It is second in length only to the Amazon River among South American rivers. The name Paraná is an abbreviation of the phrase ""para rehe onáva"", which comes from the Tupi language and means ""like the sea"" (that is, ""as big as the sea""). It merges first with the Paraguay River and then farther downstream with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata and empties into the Atlantic Ocean.
The course is formed at the confluence of the Paranaiba and Grande rivers in southern Brazil. From the confluence the river flows in a generally southwestern direction for about 619 km (385 miles) before encountering the city of Saltos del Guaira, Paraguay. This was once the location of the Sete Quedas waterfall, where the Paraná fell over a series of seven cascades. This natural feature was said to rival the world famous Iguazu Falls to the south. The falls were flooded, however, by the construction of the Itaipu dam, which began operating in 1984.
 
For approximately the next 200 km (125 miles) the Parana flows southward and forms a natural boundary between Paraguay and Brazil until the confluence with the Iguazu River. Shortly upstream from this confluence, however, the river is dammed by the impressive Itaipu Dam, the second largest hydroelectric power station in the world (after the Three Gorges Dam in the People's Republic of China), and creating a massive, shallow reservoir behind it.
 
After merging with the Iguazu, the Paraná then becomes the natural border between Paraguay and Argentina. Overlooking the Paraná River from Encarnación, Paraguay, across the river, is downtown Posadas, Argentina. The river continues its general southward course for about 468 km (291 miles) before making a gradual turn to the west for another 820 km (510 miles), and then encounters the Paraguay River, the largest tributary along the course of the river. Before this confluence the river passes through a second major hydroelectric project, the Yaciretá dam, a joint project between Paraguay and Argentina. The massive reservoir formed by the project has been the source of a number of problems for people living along the river, most notably the poorer merchants and residents in the low lying areas of Encarnación, a major city on the southern border of Paraguay. River levels rose dramatically upon completion of the dam, flooding out large sections of the city's lower areas.
 
From the confluence with the Paraguay River, the Paraná again turns to the south for another approximately 820 km (510 miles) through Argentina, making a slow turn back to the east near the city of Rosario for the final stretch of less than 500 km (310 miles) before merging with the Uruguay River to form the Río de la Plata and emptying into the Atlantic Ocean.

"I was having yum cha with some friends this afternoon, at the King Bo restaurant at the corner of Russell and Lt Bourke Streets. Around half past one, an anti-Chinese Communist Party demonstration came past. I thought it would make a good photo op, but decided -- nah, I'll just stay in the restaurant and enjoy lunch.

About a quarter of an hour later, it started to hail outside: largish lumps of ice were bouncing off car roofs, which might have been good to photograph. But you know, it was pretty hard to get out of the seat I was in, and hailstorms don't normally last that long anyway. Then the rain bucketed down. Didn't matter, it's not as if anything else interesting was about to happen.

Shortly after that, someone at our table spotted a small crowd outside one of the shops in Chinatown around 50 metres away: there was a fire coming out of a first-floor window. But by the time I pulled aside the blinds to look, there was only a little smoke and a discoloured banner left to see. By this stage, I was wishing that it was easier to get out of the restaurant so that I could grab some shots. But then, anything that could have happened, had already happened, right?

A few minutes later, I saw that passing cars were spraying water all over the place: the intersection was flooded. This time, I <b>did</b> go outside and take a few photos. But they all sucked.

Sigh. I've posted the least worst one here. But damn, there could've been more!","['2006', 'australia', 'chinatown', 'crossing', 'd70', 'flood', 'flooding', 'kerb', 'little bourke', 'melbourne', 'nikon', 'rain', 'russell st', 'soaked', 'umbrella', 'victoria', 'woman']",whitewater on russell,Attribution-NonCommercial License,63773362@N00,jpg,,104122031,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1140866834,2006-02-25 14:22:07.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/63773362@N00/104122031/,hangdog,NIKON D70

"This is by far the best selling SUV in Jamaica, and it might be the best selling new vehicle on the island period. On the day I took this I counted about 53 of them as I drove to and from the capital. 
This has a lot to do with their unique qualities. Vitaras are one of the few real trucks left. SUVs like the Rav4 and CRV are really just Camrys and Accords with some modifications, and aren't rugged at all. The Vitara, on the other hand, is built just like a truck and thus is still extremely capable off road. This quality is useful in a country where critically unkept roads are the norm and flooding is a reality for many.  
Combine that with the good looks, reliability and low price and you have a winner.

"The bus ride from Shenzhen to Enping was long, like watching a freight train chug by, except it doesn't. We had to have been on that bus for seven hours, sometimes napping, and at times, staring out our windows, looking at a world standing still. Traffic was not only a nightmare, but also a mystery, for as many instances in which we could plainly see another egregiously bad vehicular accident, that which has become commonplace, ubiquitous in Chinese travel culture, there were other inexplicable stops in movement, when all of a sudden, as though finishing a swift countdown, our speed dropped so precipitously as to let out a collective lurch, if not in body, then definitely in mind. Calvin, thankfully, in his perspicacity, in his wide-angled, unique view of things, saw beyond the myriad vehicles which lay unmoving as if rocks on a dry riverbed; view the periphery, he bade us, and when we looked to the edges of the road, indeed we witnessed the most peculiar instigator of traffic congestion in the world - men en masse pissing on the side of the road!  Men taking leaks creates a domino effect; that one sees another enjoying the relief of an unburdened, easy bladder, so seductive a yoke, that the only retort to the entreaty of this blissful state is to join in with abandon, and impunity.  And so soon as the last few shakes are made, back into the cars do these men go, and a few hasty minutes later, traffic flows again!

Mike wanted to stop at a village, so we exchanged an increasingly crowded highway for a narrow, cement road, on which we ventured into the dense verdure. Having reached an impasse in the road soon thereafter, and not knowing how to advance further, to actually enter the village proper, we saw two lovely young ladies saddling a moped, motoring towards us. They then suddenly broke, and turned off our path and onto a dirt one which squeezed through two homes as though a mouse through its diminutive hole - that was our key. We greeted them as the girls turned their heads, offering us inquisitive, yet gentle looks. They would be our guides into town.

Blue showed me around her neighborhood. Together we walked along bumpy corridors and peered through open windows, beyond flitting cobwebs, to lay eyes on rooms where nowadays only impenetrable shadows repose. She and I examined the perfunctory red banners which framed each door in the village, and subsequently hit it off when I began inquiring into the nature of those two swarthy demons who hung menacingly before the closed doors, their gazes insidiously wild, drunk with rage, perhaps. Indeed later, in the quietude of a sunset raining down on us, while standing by ourselves in front of the village hall, I finally shared my faith with her, and in return she declared the lack of her own - her cousin and older sister, however, do know Jesus, she said, which verily warmed my heart, if not hers.

We left the village with much rapidity, but not before I blessed and encouraged Blue's cousin, in whose arms a smiling babe lay, and received joyfully a delectable departing gift: mysterious, ""Blue Cookies"" (the official Chinese name is 艾糍), whose mottled, homely complexion would disgust if not for the sweetness (an amalgam of sugar, peanuts and herbs) buried inside, a treasure which would be discovered again and again on our tour.

The food around Enping epitomizes, I believe, Guangdong cuisine: inexpensive and egregiously non-spicy. For what they lack in price and incendiary acidity, however, these dishes more than compensate with copious amounts of oil, salt and sugar, mixed together for a tantalizing effect on the taste buds. Our group was fortunate enough to have frequented several Guangdong-style dai pai dongs whose victuals both nourished our bodies and replenished our wallets - it's amazing to consider how $250RMB can feed 15 ravenous, cantankerous-when-hungry Christian bikers. In fact, the feasting grew exponentially more enjoyable as journey progressed, as our two primary orderers began to refine their culinary acuity, accurately predicting what would invigorate and excite our collective palate; it helped, too, that our utensils were pretty clean for Chinese standards!

Our first evening, we secured accommodations in a building that was not so much a hotel, or even a motel, as a grey, dry concrete edifice in which hardwood beds were arrayed neatly in each room; the spartan conditions dismayed some, including myself, at first.  However, thankfulness trumped peevishness, and the realization that, in the middle of nowhere, we had mosquito nets to ward off the inexorable squad of mozzies, and one bathroom with boiling water for a very, very scalding shower was more than enough to placate everyone, especially after a hard day of riding.  Besides, austerity succors the soul.  We even managed to sleep pretty soundly without mattresses.  In my somnolent state, I only remember shifting desperately maybe six, or seven times.  It was a good night, and a bargain at only 15RMB per person!

On the second day our group dared to test itself on an unknown avenue. Consequently, we were spared the sonorous alarms of gigantic, indomitable trucks and instead subjected ourselves to the vicissitudes of off-road biking, whose soundtrack, undoubtedly for the day, was provided by an orchestra of buzzing cicadas, accompanied, at times, by the rumbling tympani of motorbikes. Oh, the countryside was lush, beautiful verdure all around - a feast for the romantic soul. Yet, for one of my companions, the environment was anything but endearing, for her adeptness at handling the desultory trail, she surely felt, was more chaotic than controlled. She persevered, nonetheless, pushing through her disconsolation to conquer the race marked out for her; such tenacity that only the Father could supply; and that left me thoroughly impressed.

At lunchtime, the evangelization effort began in earnest.  It started innocently enough, as I asked a group of girls about the secondary school down the dusty road from our restaurant.  Then, on cue, the Spirit, whose pacing can only be described as frenetic, whose rhythm is beyond my comprehension, overwhelmed and took over.  Leanne and I brought those three girls to Christ; while Tim was assiduously preaching by our side to a band of boys who had gathered to look on; and behind us, ah Cheung had cajoled five boys to form a circle, hand in hand, for prayer.  Many people came to know Jesus that hour.  There was undoubtedly some serious fire falling down on us!

We made a pit stop at the Tam clan village.  It was another bucolic community, replete with idling boys, young and old,  and those two duplicitous demons standing watch from steady doors, which, it appeared, held together together the ramshackle walls beside them.  An electricity meter evinced the reality of life in the village, of a living community that flows flittingly in and out of the houses as though cats leaping over canals; because I for one couldn't see how hundreds of people somehow resided inside those homes when I couldn't spot a single one during my brief tour of the grounds.  In the open, by our bikes, there were conspicuous signs of life, however.  I  was standing in the sun, letting its warm rays melt on my skin, when a young man, not even twenty, approached and asked me about our intents and purposes on what was once such a dull afternoon.  His curiosity got the better of me, and together we broached a conversation in faith.  Simon joined us, and although he whom I named Henry, told us in his obstinacy that he depends on himself alone, I feel as though a small seed of faith was still planted within him.  May it bloom at the appointed time when he most needs it. 

At last, inside the unlit store where we shared our gleaming hopes and fantastic dreams, Simon and I noticed, to our surprise and delight, two blackboards on which the shopkeeper had written the alphabet, for English as well as for Putonghua (Pinyin).  Besides the letters, numbers too had been painstakingly etched into the board, each meticulous stroke perfectly formed.  So they ironically were learning that which continues to elude their more economically mobile brethren in Hong Kong, despite their most humble upbringing.  I encouraged Henry to pursue this knowledge, since, as the cliche most rightly states, English - and Putonghua, these days - opens up a world of opportunity. 

China, it seems to me, is one interminable housing start being carried on the shoulders of giants. Behemoths, really, an armada of green and blue dump trucks, on whose backs are the physical manifestation of the hopes and dreams of billions - timber; stone; and coal - were an inescapable part of our three-day trek. They blew passed us, literally, horns afire; and if you stared into the eyes of the drivers high above on those mechanized elephants, you would see the glee with which they pounded both the road and the eardrums of those unwitting peons foolish enough to be nearby. China - and China Mobile, whose stores we uncovered even in the most remote suburb, might I add! - still has much growth left, and the transportation and infrastructure industries, I'm sure, shall assiduously work to keep it that way. My recommendation: keep investing in China.

Visiting the hot springs had been on our agenda since the inception of the trip.  We eventually had our chance the second evening, when we raced down a wending hill to our hotel - a real hotel.  Our excitement reverberated in the air, crackling with laughter and shouting.  Choosing to swim first and foremost, we left dinner to wait and hurried across the street.  The resort was packed with other like-minded people, dressed in swimming costumes that should have left more to the imagination; the temperature of the pool water varied, from tepid in one enclosure to skin-searing in another; and for one marvelous hour, we swam and frolicked like little children again, delighting in some wet fun, a suitable reward for one more arduous day spent on the dusty, dry land. 

We capped the end of a successful day with a bang.  The girls, oddly enough, were furtive pyromaniacs in our midst, longing in secret to raid the fireworks shop at the base of the hotel.  So after our meal, they raced into the cool evening air and we could only endeavor to follow them in their explosive folly.  Inside the store, all sorts of bombastic devices were on display, from the unwieldy, block of (Chicago) bull to the sleek spears adorning the wall whose warheads, no doubt, could just so easily take out a few eyes as mercilessly rip the pitch black from the wall of night sky.  The ladies suffered to leave no type of firework untouched by the flame, quickly purchasing an arsenal of rainbow-inducing rockets and slim sparklers to make any pyrotechnic maven proud.  Outside we went.  At length, the bombs burst in the air, and laughter abound so much as we watched the brilliance of Chinese engineering on display.  With the girls' scintillating stock depleted, we finally collected ourselves, and headed upstairs for one more day of wonderment.

There was one last village to visit before we reached our final destination of Enping city.  As we sped into the shanty community, we knew something was amiss because unlike our other entrances into villages, during which residents would emerge in droves to glimpse us, it seemed as though these villagers preferred the comfort of their own veiled homes to the company of a few, ebullient strangers.  It was an ominous setting in which we found ourselves, one characterized by inhabitants rather mistrustful than gregarious, and affable.  Nonetheless, we dispersed to share kindness and mercy.  To that end, I approached a young lady, a mere 25-years old, who had her three-month old boy on her shoulder and her three-year old son - who was without pants, might I add, preferring to wave them in the air like a terrible towel - by her side.  We spoke briefly about her hopes and dreams, which, she says, rest in the well-being of her sons; and then Leanne and I blessed her.  That was the end of our village experience in China.

To be around people who sharpen you as iron sharpens iron, that verily is a joy.  The villagers were simple, warm and welcoming; my teammates were jocular, presumptuous and faithful; and I, in the midst of this confluence, this mosaic of personalities, philosophies, hopes and dreams, could only seek to love, especially in one of my more pensive moments.  The trip tested my patience and tolerance, my ability to accept others for who they are - each a flawed creature like myself.   Ultimately, so much as we seek the men of peace everywhere we go, we individually must become men of peace too.  A true disciple of Jesus runs that race, and appreciates His grace, which shall always be enough in this life.","['bicycle', 'biking', 'china', 'chinese', 'city', 'cycling', 'enping', 'farmers', 'guangdong', 'people', 'road', 'rural', 'tour', 'trip', 'village']",IMG_2514,Attribution-NoDerivs License,7310714@N06,jpg,,3503502871,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/,1241523747,2009-05-02 17:31:50.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/7310714@N06/3503502871/,Wootang01,Canon DIGITAL IXUS 70

"Much of the 56,500ha Mossman Gorge Section of Daintree National Park includes rugged, largely inaccessible slopes of the Main Coast Range and Carbine Tableland, adjoining Mt Windsor and Mt Lewis. It is these steep mountain ranges that trap moisture blown in from the ocean and ensure frequent rainfall, maintaining the rainforest and ultimately feeding the Mossman and Daintree Rivers. Tall, dense rainforests clothe the lowlands and stunted windswept rainforests occupy the mountaintops. To the west of the Main Coast Range, open forest and woodlands grow on the drier western slopes. The park provides a home for a wonderful variety of rainforest animals including tree-kangaroos, musky rat-kangaroos and Boyd’s forest dragons. Over millions of years, the Mossman River has carved a steep-sided valley from the upper reaches to the coastal lowlands. Through this valley, crystal clear water cascades amongst large granite boulders which have been washed down from the hills during times of heavy flood. The Mossman Gorge Section is part of the traditional lands of the Kuku Yalanji people.

"The little wall and part of the road on Grenville Place collapsed on the early hours of Friday 20th November 2009 due to the stream of the Lee river strengthen by water release of the critically full dam in Inniscarra, 8miles ahead.
As part of the research on sensors for water quality control, the Tyndall National Institute was monitoring the Lee river level as that time. The usual oscillation pattern between high and low tide break down at this period, more likely because of a massive release of water from the dam.

The interior of the building was also filled with mud and housed the breeding and spawning tanks. 

Due to re-open this year in May or June, the main building is being restored and will house a number of public displays, the pond has already been restored and now is filled with friendly Rainbows.

"The Old Stirling Bridge which crosses the River Forth.

<i>This impressive late 15th century bridge was for almost four centuries the lowest bridging point over the River Forth, until Stirling New Bridge opened in 1831

On the River Forth off the M9 at Stirling  you will come accross Stirling's Old Bridge. 

Duties were levied on goods entering the Burgh and customs men sat in a covered booth in a recess in the middle of the bridge.

In 1571 a gallows was erected on the bridge to hang Archbishop Hamilton.

In 1745, the Southernmost arch was blown up by general Blackney to prevent the Highlanders from crossing.

Prior to the building of this Bridge there were earlier structures, one of these bridges included the wooden bridge, a little further down the river forth,  where Sir William Wallace defeated the English at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297. The Bridge is well worth a visit and offers impressive views of the surrounding area

"I didn’t get a chance to take the shot from this angle when it was sunny and clear until June 2006. So there you go the mosque under sunny blue sky! 

I climbed to the top of at least 3 minarets when building the mosque was near completion in the early 1980s. I did it with a childhood friend. We were young boys then, full of adventure and had enough *skills* to hack our way to the top. I still remember the panoramic view that we marveled at when we finally reached the very top of each minaret. Fabulously unparalleled.  Blida, like you have never seen it before!

In November 2005, I paid the mosque a visit again. It was sunny, breezy, and November cold was out. I felt the urge to climb again. I behaved and asked for permission this time, sort of. It was granted. I climbed the north east minaret (front left in the photo), reached the very top, and shot some pics of Blida from above. Some of them are here in this <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/bachir/sets/1470305/"">set</a>. I felt almost the same feelings I felt when I was a young boy. Not much difference at all. The only difference this time was having my camera.  So I was able to make those feelings and moments unforgettable.   

Thanks for reading.","['البليدة', 'الجزائر', 'مسجد', 'algeria', 'blida', 'dome', 'minaret', 'mosque']",Al-kawthar........An Encore!,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,36241474@N00,jpg,2.829601,216421943,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1155687100,2006-06-11 02:50:00.0,36.468698,http://www.flickr.com/photos/36241474@N00/216421943/,Bachir,"X100,D540Z,C310Z"

"The vacation to San Diego is over for me. And now that I’m typing this up at 6 in the morning while I get ready to go to school in below freezing temperatures, I wonder why I ever left. I want sunny beaches and palm trees!!! Is that too much to ask for?! :P

I was practically sprinting around San Diego to get in as many shots as I could at different locations before the light faded. The beach is right behind the rollercoaster in this shot. They also have an ‘indoor’ surfing wave thing at this place. It’s actually outdoors but it’s in a little box that shoots water up a slope and you can surf the wave it makes for as long as you want. Seems kind of ironic to me to put one right next to a beach though.

The Prince Hall Masonic Lodge (or Masonic Temple Building in the nomination form for the National Register of Historic Places) was the first lodge built by the black fraternal organizations in Raleigh. The roots of the lodge reach back just after the Civil War to the organization of Widow’s Son Lodge No. 4 in 1867 by Bishop James W. Hood. In 1870 the Masonic lodges of Raleigh, Wilmington, Fayetteville and New Bern united as the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of North Carolina. The building was constructed in 1907 and planned for lodge meetings, social gatherings such as dances, and space for business on the ground level. The Masons helped spur growth in SE Raleigh by the location of their lodge. It’s a rectangular three-story wood-frame building with a flat roof and with brick veneer and Italianate detailing. Separating the first level with the second is a metal cornice, needing a little repair. Fenestration on the upper levels of the front façade features segmental-arched windows; there are raised brick partial surrounds, an aspect of the Italianate style. Under each window is a recessed panel. The original entrance was in the cut-away corner, which is supported by cast-iron columns, fluted with a modified capital of the Corinthian order. The structure has its own listing on the National Register, added May 3, 1984 with ID#84002533.

"From Wikipedia

Ḳoca Mi‘mār Sinān Āġā (Ottoman Turkish: خوجه معمار سنان آغا) (April 15, 1489 - July 17, 1588) was the chief Ottoman architect and civil engineer for sultans Selim I, Suleiman I, Selim II and Murad III. He was, during a period of fifty years, responsible for the construction or the supervision of every major building in the Ottoman Empire. More than three hundred structures are credited to his name, exclusive of his more modest projects, such as his Koran schools (sibyan mektebs).

His masterpiece is the Selimiye Mosque in Edirne, although his most famous work is the Suleiman Mosque in Istanbul. He had under him an extensive governmental department and trained many assistants who, in turn, distinguished themselves, including Sedefhar Mehmet Ağa, architect of the Sultan Ahmed Mosque. He is considered the greatest architect of the classical period, and is often compared to Michelangelo as a Western contemporary. The stature of Michelangelo and his plans for St Peter's Basilica in Rome were well-known in Istanbul, since he (and also Leonardo da Vinci) received an invitation to build a bridge over the Bosphorus.[1]  

Conclusion

At the start of his career as an architect, Sinan had to deal with an established, traditional domed architecture. His training as an army engineer led him to approach architecture from an empirical point of view, rather than from a theoretical one. He started to experiment with the design and engineering of single-domed and multiple-domed structures. He tried to obtain a new geometrical purity, a rationality and a spatial integrity in his structures and designs of mosques. Through all this, he demonstrated his creativity and his wish to create a clear, unified space. He started to develop a series of variations on the domes, surrounding them in different ways with semi-domes, piers, screen walls and different sets of galleries. His domes and arches are curved, but he avoided curvilinear elements in the rest of his design, transforming the circle of the dome into a rectangular, hexagonal or octagonal system. He tried to obtain a rational harmony between the exterior pyramidal composition of semi-domes, culminating in a single drumless dome, and the interior space where this central dome vertically integrates the space into a unified whole. His genius lies in the organization of this space and in the resolution of the tensions created by the design. He was also an innovator in the use of decoration and motifs, merging them into the architectural forms as a whole. He accentuated the centre underneath the central dome by flooding it with light from the many windows. He incorporated his mosques in an efficient way into a complex (külliye), serving the needs of the community as an intellectual centre, a community centre and serving the social needs and the health problems of the faithful.

When Sinan died, the classical Ottoman architecture had reached its climax. No successor was gifted enough to better the design of the Selimiye mosque and to develop it any further. His students retreated to earlier models, such as the Şehzade mosque. Invention faded away and a decline set in...

He died in 1588 and is buried in a tomb, a türbe of his own design, in the cemetery just outside the walls of the Süleymaniye Mosque to the north, across a street named Mimar Sinan Caddesi in his honour. He was buried near the tombs of his greatest patrons sultan Süleyman and his wife Haseki Hürrem.","['architect', 'istanbul', 'mimar sinan', 'sinan', 'türkiyeturchia', 'tomb', 'turkey']",Tomb of Mimar Sinan,Attribution-NonCommercial License,10149612@N08,jpg,28.963834,2335348484,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1205596009,2008-03-02 13:13:32.0,41.017323,http://www.flickr.com/photos/10149612@N08/2335348484/,Vince Millett,Canon EOS 350D DIGITAL

[edit] Geography

Manali is located at [show location on an interactive map] 32°10′N 77°06′E﻿ / ﻿32.16, 77.1[1]. It has an average elevation of 2625 metres (8612 feet).

[edit] Demographics

As of 2001 India census[2], Manali had a population of 6265. Males constitute 64% of the population and females 36%. Manali has an average literacy rate of 74%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 80%, and female literacy is 63%. In Manali, 9% of the population is under 6 years of age.

[edit] Etymology

Manali is named after the Brahmin lawgiver Manu. The word Manali literally means “the abode of Manu”. Legend has it that sage Manu stepped off his ark in Manali to recreate human life after a great flood had deluged the world. Manali is known as the ""Valley of the Gods"". The Old Manali village has an ancient temple dedicated to sage Manu.

[edit] History

In ancient times, the valley was sparsely populated by nomadic hunters known as ""rakshas"". The next arrivals were the shepherds who arrived from the Kangra valley and settled to take up agriculture. Some of the earliest inhabitants of the region are the 'naur' or 'nar', which is a caste unique to the Kullu valley. Only a few naur families are known to exist now. A naur family in the village Soyal near Haripur on the west bank of Manali was famous for the vast land they owned and their practice of having 'rakshas' as their labourers.

The British were responsible for introducing apples and trout which were not native to Manali. It is said that when apple trees were first planted the fruits were so plentiful that often branches, unable to bear the weight would collapse. To this day apple along with plum and pear remains the best source of income for the majority of its inhabitants.

Tourism in Manali received a real boost after the rise of militancy in Kashmir in the late 1980s. This once quiet village was transformed into a bustling town with hundreds of hotels and restaurants.

"I'm so glad I invested in new patio doors...

Because 'it never rains in Southern California', we don't have any drainage, so ths kind of thing happens all too easily.

I expect the roads down in the Valley to be six inhes deep in water.

I'm so glad I bought an Audi with AWD.

From Accuweather.com

Western Expert Meteorologist Paul Yeager declares the potential exists that ""some of the foothills from Ventura County (and perhaps Santa Barbara County), southward through the Los Angeles basin will receive 5 to 10 inches of rain from late on Saturday through Sunday....with amounts of greater than two inches in most lower-elevation locations."" 

 That amount of rain falling not only in a short period of time, but also onto a ground already saturated by recent rain could cause potentially dangerous flooding and mudslides. The threat will be the greatest, but certainly not limited to the areas burned by last year's wildfires. 

With the offshore storm set to slide southwestward before moving back towards the coast on Saturday, snow levels will be on the rise. Snow levels will increase to 5,000 feet this afternoon in Southern California and 3,000 feet across the north. 

The arrival of the heavy rain in Southern California on Saturday night will come as snow levels soar to 8,000 feet. The high snow levels will mean a soaking of rain, not blanketing snow for most ski resorts. The rain in the mountains will change back to snow on Sunday as snow levels plummet. 

The rise in snow levels over Southern California today will allow conditions to improve in the Tejon Pass, the corridor of Interstate 5 that connects central and Southern California. According to KNBC-TV, the major freeway, commonly referred to as the Grapevine, remains closed to motorists. The Grapevine has been shut down since Wednesday afternoon, only opening for 40 minutes early on Thursday afternoon.","['california', 'downpour', 'drenched', 'eye-fi', 'lake', 'loud!', 'ocean', 'pond', 'rain', 'severe', 'sfv', 'showers', 'soaking', 'southern', 'storm', 'torrential', 'warning', 'weather', 'wet']",Typical So Cal drainage problem...,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,97855011@N00,jpg,,2218209641,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1201275666,2008-01-25 07:40:32.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/97855011@N00/2218209641/,11thEarlOfMar,Canon PowerShot A430

"Estrada Real, perto de São Lourenço, Minas Gerais - Brasil

Um pouco da história da Estrada Real:
A Estrada Real ( pronúncia Português:  [iʃtɾadɐ ʁeaw] , Royal Road ) é uma era colonial- estrada no Brasil . Português colonos do Brasil e seus Africano escravos começaram a construir a Estrada Real em 1697 logo após o ouro , diamantes e outros preciosos minerais foram descobertos no atual estado de Minas Gerais . O propósito da estrada foi para facilitar a circulação desses minerais do interior para o litoral e daí para Lisboa . A estrada do Caminho Velho original começou em Paraty e foi para o norte através das cidades de São João del-Rey, Tiradentes, Coronel Xavier Chaves, Congonhas, Itatiaia e, finalmente, Vila Rica , hoje Ouro Preto . Mais tarde, a distância para Ouro Preto foi encurtada pelo Caminho Novo , que começou a partir de Rio de Janeiro . A estrada foi estendida para o norte através de Mariana , Catas Altas, Santa Bárbara, Barão de Cocais, Ipoema, deo Conceição Mato Dentro, Serro, São Gonçalo do Rio das Pedras, e, no ponto mais setentrional, Diamantina . A duração de ambas as estradas combinado é de cerca de 1,400 km (850 mi).
Transporte ao longo da estrada foi rigidamente controlado por agentes da Coroa para impedir o contrabando eo movimento não autorizado. Mercadorias eram transportadas em comboios de mulas conhecido como tropas , liderada pelo tropeiro tropeiros . Produtos provenientes de Portugal fizeram o seu caminho até a estrada, enquanto os minerais fizeram o seu caminho para o litoral, como fabricação e muitas colheitas foram proibidas pela Coroa, de modo a manter a região economicamente dependente de Portugal. Muitos dos do Brasil pratos saudáveis ​​, como feijão tropeiro e tutu , foram originalmente elaborados pela tropeiros , que precisava de alimentos que poderiam ser transportados sem estragar .
As cidades ao longo da Estrada Real foram opulenta nos dias de ouro e diamantes, mas até o final do século 18, os minerais tornou-se mais escassos ea economia entrou em declínio. Os recentes esforços governamentais e organizações não-governamentais estão a transformar a Estrada Real em uma rota que leva os turistas através do berço da cultura brasileira . A estrada ainda é maioritariamente não-pavimentadas , e as cidades e vilas ao longo do caminho aparecem muito o que eles fizeram no século 19. Magníficas igrejas ainda estão em cidades que tenham sido economicamente estagnada por mais de um século. A iniciativa de turismo é educar as pessoas para manter suas formas tradicionais e preservar a arquitetura barroca de suas igrejas e edifícios antigos do governo.

A little history of the Royal Road:

The Estrada Real (Portuguese pronunciation: [iʃˈtɾadɐ ʁeˈaw], Royal Road) is a colonial-era road in Brazil. Portuguese colonists of Brazil and their African slaves began building the Estrada Real in 1697 shortly after gold, diamonds, and other precious minerals were discovered in the present-day state of Minas Gerais. The purpose of the road was to facilitate the movement of those minerals from the interior to the coast and thence to Lisbon. The original road—the Caminho Velho—began in Paraty and went north through the towns of São João del-Rey, Tiradentes, Coronel Xavier Chaves, Congonhas, Itatiaia and, ultimately, Vila Rica, today's Ouro Preto. Later, the distance to Ouro Preto was shortened by the Caminho Novo, which started from Rio de Janeiro. The road was extended northward through Mariana, Catas Altas, Santa Bárbara, Barão de Cocais, Ipoema, Conceição deo Mato Dentro, Serro, São Gonçalo do Rio das Pedras, and, at the northernmost point, Diamantina. The length of both roads combined is about 1,400 km (850 mi).
Transportation along the road was tightly controlled by agents of the Crown to prevent smuggling and unauthorized movement. Goods were transported in mule trains known as tropas, led by tropeiro mule drivers. Products from Portugal made their way up the road while minerals made their way to the coast, as manufacturing and many crops were prohibited by the Crown so as to keep the region economically dependent on Portugal. Many of Brazil's hearty dishes, such as feijão tropeiro and tutu, were originally prepared by the tropeiros, who needed food that could be transported without spoiling.
The towns along the Estrada Real were opulent in the days of gold and diamonds, but by the end of the 18th century, the minerals became more scarce and the economy went into decline. Recent efforts by governmental and non-governmental organizations are turning the Estrada Real into a route that leads tourists through the cradle of Brazilian culture. The road is still mostly unpaved, and the towns and villages along the way appear much the way they did in the 19th century. Magnificent churches still stand in towns that have been economically stagnant for over a century. The tourism initiative is educating people to retain their traditional ways and preserve the Baroque architecture of their old churches and government buildings.",[],Entre curvas...Uma montanha de hortências!

Un any que ha suposat un important canvi al fer el relleu al material fotogràfic, deixant enrere a la 1000D per deixar pas a la imponent 1D Mark II que tantes alegries m’ha donat fins ara (i les que queden). Un any en el que he conegut a grans persones amb les que he passat grans moments. En definitiva un gran any.

Un año que ha supuesto un importante cambio al hacer el relevo al material fotográfico, dejando atrás a la 1000D para dejar paso a la imponente 1D Mark II que tantas alegrías me ha dado hasta ahora (y las que quedan).

<i> Another year has passed and we fired today, with 23 making it go already. One year, 2012, you would say that it was great for a server. And during this year is now behind us can say that I've grown a lot as a person, but I think I've grown a lot as well as future photographer, and more since in September 2011 to start to study the CFGS of Imatge on Emav. A year marked an important change to make the relay to the photographic material, leaving the 1000D to make way for the awesome 1D Mark II that has given me so much joy so far (and left). A year in which I met great people I've had great moments. Definitely a great year. To dismiss, this photo, excellent tourist train in my area, the Train dels Llacs of ARMF, about to enter to Àger station, road Pobla de Segur. Happy 2013 to all!</i>

"Taken from the west part of the polder ""De Beemster"". On the dyke to the town called ""De Rijp"".  Below the dyke is the fortress of ""Spijkerboor"" whom is a part of the a UNESCO World Heritage site. This photo showes 2 of the UNESCO World Heritage sites, (1) Polder ""De Beemster"" and the (2) Defence line of Amsterdam in Dutch ""Stelling van Amsterdam"".

The Beemster Polder.

The UNESCO World Heritage Site Beemster is a municipality in the Netherlands, in the province of North Holland. Also, the Beemster is the first so-called polder in the Netherlands that was reclaimed from a lake, the water being extracted out of the lake by windmills. The Beemster Polder was dried during the period 1609 through 1612. It has preserved intact its well-ordered landscape of fields, roads, canals, dykes and settlements, laid out in accordance with classical and Renaissance planning principles. A grid of canals parallels the grid of roads in the Beemster. The grids are offset: the larger feeder canals are offset by approximately one kilometer from the larger roads.

Defence Line of Amsterdam, (De Stelling van Amsterdam).

The UNESCO World Heritage Site known as the Defense line of Amsterdam (in Dutch named Stelling van Amsterdam) is a 135 km long ring of fortifications around Amsterdam, consisting of 42 forts located between 10 to 15 kilometers the centre, and lowlands that can easily be flooded in time of war. The flooding was designed to give a depth of about 30 cm, insufficient for boats to traverse. Any buildings within 1 km of the line had to be made of wood, so that they could be burnt and the obstruction removed.

The Stelling van Amsterdam was constructed between 1880 and 1920. The invention of the aeroplane and tank made the forts obsolete almost as soon as they were finished. Many of the forts now are under the control of the town councils and the nature department, and may be visited. Monuments Day, on the second Saturday in September, is the ideal day to visit as entrance is free.","['2007', 'beemster', 'bomen', 'boom', 'december', 'december-2007', 'fort-bij-spijkerboor', 'shoot-it', 'spijkerboor', 'stelling-van-amsterdam', 'tree', 'trees', 'unesco', 'winter', 'world heritage']",World Heritage Sites,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,76932691@N00,jpg,,2202305650,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1200681394,2007-12-22 11:45:14.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/76932691@N00/2202305650/,shoot it!,Canon EOS 5D

"From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

The Great Synagogue of Florence or Tempio Maggiore is a notable synagogue in Florence, Italy.

The synagogue was built between 1874 and 1882. The architects were Mariano Falcini, Professor Vincente Micheli, and Marco Treves, who was Jewish. Their design integrated the architectural traditions of the Islamic and Italian worlds. 

Layers of travertine and granite alternate in the masonry, creating a striped effect like that of the Siena Cathedral. Old photographs show bold red and beige stripes, but the bold colors of the stone have faded over time, leaving a more mottled effect.

 
Dome of the synagogueThe overall form of the synagogue is the cruciform plan of Hagia Sophia emulated by so many mosques. The corner towers are topped with horseshoe-arched towers themselves topped with onion domes in the Moorish Revival style. Three horseshoe arches form the main entrance, above it rise tiers of ajimez windows, with their paired horseshoe arches sharing a single column.

Inside the building ""every square inch is covered with colored designs,"" in Moorish patterns. The interior mosaics and frescoes inside are by Giovanni Panti. Giacomo del Medico designed the great arch.

During World War II Fascist solders used the synagogue as a vehicle garage. In August 1944 retreating German troops worked with Italian Fascists to destroy the synagogue, but the Italian resistance managed to defuse most of the explosives. Only a limited amount of damage was done. The synagogue was restored after the war. It was restored again after damage by massive flooding in 1966.","[""'great"", ""florence'"", 'great synagogue of florence', 'peer gynt photos', 'synagogue']",Great Synagogue of Florence,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,25554263@N04,jpg,11.266586,5227122264,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1291316029,2010-08-25 18:18:59.0,43.772658,http://www.flickr.com/photos/25554263@N04/5227122264/,Peer.Gynt,SAMSUNG TECHWIN Co.

"A sign outside the dugout provided the following paragraph of information:
""This dugout is typical of the temporary home built by the homesteader upon arrival on the prairie of southwest Minnesota.  A hole was dug first (thus the name dugout) and sod walls were built around the hole.  There were many dugouts in this area.  All have disappeared, including the Laura Ingalls dugout.  A sign marks the spot where it once stood north of Walnut Grove, MN.  This 18' by 18' replica was built in 1988.  Although it's bigger than Laura's dugout, the roof, the floor, and the simple furnishings inside show you her lifestyle.""

Sod House on the Prairie is an actual tourist destination located in Sanborn, MN, on the Laura Ingalls Historic Highway.

Information on the attraction's website states that Stan McCone built several sod replicas in 1987-1988 as a personal tribute to the homesteaders who came to the prairie. Stan and his family presently live on the farm site where the sod buildings are standing.

The one room soddy is made of sod walls two feet thick, and it has a lumber roof and floor.  Inside it's furnished like the 1880 period.  Near the sod house is a replica of a dugout, a much smaller and simpler structure that served as the initial shelter settlers created upon arriving, prior to building their sod house.  The dugout has a floor and walls made of dirt, and a roof of cottonwood poles & dried grass.  There is a ladder that leads to a small loft.  Furnishings were very plain and simple.

Stan also built a sod outhouse, which served as the bathroom facility for guests who stayed overnight in the sod house when it was used as a bed & breakfast.

In addition, there is a small log cabin that was built to replicate a trapper's cabin.  It's about the size of the dugout in which Laura Ingalls' family lived, and contains furs, traps, and Indian things.

Surrounding the buildings are ten acres of restored prairie grasses six to eight feet tall.  Pioneers called the prairie the ""sea of grass"" because it grew so tall in places that a person would need to stand on a horse just to see the land ahead.  There are some trails where you can walk and enjoy the colorful flowers and grasses growing together.

Castle Loevestein (Slot Loevestein in Dutch) is a medieval castle built by the knight Dirc Loef van Horne (hence ""Loef's stein"" ((stone)) house) in 1361. It was built in a strategic location in the middle of the Netherlands, where the Maas and Waal rivers come together (just west of current day villages Poederoijen and Brakel, in the municipality of Zaltbommel, in Gelderland). At first it was a simple square brick building, used to charge toll from trading vessels using the rivers. In the 16th century it was expanded to a larger fortress surrounded by earthen fortifications, two moats, an arsenal, and housing for a commander and soldiers. It changed hands twice between the Northern Dutch and the Spanish, the warring parties of the day. The castle soon became a prison for political prisoners. One famous inmate was the eminent lawyer, poet and politician Hugo de Groot (Hugo Grotius) often presented as the ""father of modern international law"", who was serving a controversially imposed life sentence from 1619. In 1621 Hugo de Groot managed to pull off a daring escape in a book chest. He subsequently became the Swedish Ambassador to France for 10 years. Another high profile inmate was the English Vice-Admiral George Ayscue.

Until the Second World War Loevestein Castle was part of the Nieuwe Hollandse Waterlinie, the main Dutch defense line that was based on flooding the land south of the western provinces.

Currently the castle is used as a medieval museum and function centre. Some make out the castle is haunted. (Wikipedia)

"Richard J. Daley Center

Architect:     C.F. Murphy Associates
Date:              1965
Style:              International
Address:       50 West Washington Street
Height:          648 ft. (32 Floors)
Exterior:       Exposed Corten Steel
Structural 
Material:      Steel
Program:      Court House and Government Office

      The structural columns of the Richard J. Daley Center are 87 feet apart, which is a relatively large span. Towards the top of the columns, the width diminishes as the floors require less support. 
     For four years, from 1965 to 1969, the Daley Center was the tallest building in Chicago. In 2001, it received historical status, only 36 years after its completion. The building has a small height to floor ratio, due to the large floor to floor distance of 18 feet.","['1965', 'c.f. murphy associates', 'chicago', 'chicago architecture today', 'corten steel', 'courthouse', 'downtown chicago', 'government buildings', 'historical buildings', 'richard j. daley', 'skyscrapers.  historical buildings downtown chicago richard j. daley courthouse government buildings steel structure corten steel c.f. murphy associates chicago architecture today 1965', 'steel structure']",Ext 04,Attribution License,39527980@N08,jpg,,6307713071,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1320292511,2011-10-06 03:49:58.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/39527980@N08/6307713071/,Chicago Architecture Today,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D3000

"Tunbridge, Vermont, USA

The original Mill Bridge was built in 1883 and destroyed in 1999 by heavy Spring flooding and ice. In 2000 a reconstruction was completed just over a year later. This sign looked older than ten years to me, so I'm guessing it was from the original.

"<a href=""http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/heyl/s_574012.html"">A somewhat critical article last year</a> ridiculed the trail because it will be along the river and prone to flooding. Commentator Eric Heyl doesn't even question the wisdom of having a parking lot there in the first place. If building a bike trail that floods is a bad idea then shouldn't building a parking lot that floods be an equally bad idea? Especially when the cars of inattentive drivers that get caught by rising flood waters are essentially destroyed? Of course, in the eyes of an autodominionist, more parking is good, even if that parking is sporadic or risky and cyclists who ask for the same sporadic or risky access are foolish. Especially if the cyclist's access means a loss of parking spaces. (In this case, 150-200 of the current 750 spaces.)

The author is exaggerating a bit when he says the wharf is ""constantly under water"" and dubs the project the ""Jacques Cousteau Trail"". Typically, the Mon Wharf floods a few times a year, 2 to 5 times and sometimes for a long as a week. No where near ""constantly."" And while he ridicules the trail that may be unusable 7% of the time, to us who up until this point have had no trail at all and must ride in the street to get to the point, even an occasionally flooded trail will be an improvement of 1300%.

So worth the occasional inconvenience.","['biketrail', 'biking', 'great allegheny passage', 'mon wharf trail', 'monongahala river', 'monongahela']",Mon Wharf Trail: Week 11,Attribution-NonCommercial License,25329410@N00,jpg,-80.001261,3508909824,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1241649124,2009-05-05 12:54:47.0,40.436319,http://www.flickr.com/photos/25329410@N00/3508909824/,Kordite,NIKON COOLPIX L4

"This is a bad idea, in landscape form.

The story that would have Portland's so-called ""South Waterfront"" developed is long and sordid.  Briefly, OHSU told the city, ""we could lure a bunch of smart and weathy bio-tech professionals here if we had another building.  ""Pill Hill"" where the rest of the OHSU capus is located is full.  

""We'll do anything,"" the city said.  Portland already has more young, over-educated people than just about any city in the US.  ""Let's get them out of their restaurant jobs and off the dole and into bio-med.  That's cool, right?""  As my aunt would say, Bless their hearts.  They just thought they were helping and ""bio-medical molecular engineering"" and ""designer genes"" just sounds sexy, like Portland usually isn't.

A notorious developer comes in and says, ""I've got just the spot.""  This part of town is notorious as a sort of Bermuda Tridangle where roads added in the 1960s cut off every route of escape from those neighborhoods (the ones with addresses that start in 0) that lie between the hill and the desolate, regularly flooded part of the city that no sane person would build a shack on, much less a large skyscraper full of medical buildings or condos.

You look at it and say, ""Oh, don' they know that's gonna flood?""  The water front park area floods at least every 40 years, p'bly more like 20 and that's well above here.

Then there's climate change to consider.  Sure, we won't have as many rainy days, but we will, for the forseeable future continue to get just as much rain, if current models hold true.  It just won't come all winter and spring as it currently does.  Sunny days with the occasional deluge is how chaotic weather unfolds here.  No hurricanes, thank goodness, but regular flooding events.  

Ahem... .  City hall?  Why did you give this developer so  much money you'll have to defer maintenance in SE for another 20 years?  SE has a bridge that is already unsafe for truck traffic, actual unpaved roads in the city limits, potholes that can swallow small children and bus stops in ditches.  All those monies go into producing overwrought transport for a doomed population of yuppies.  Aaaarrrggghhhh!

Oh, and that spiky thing on the right is the sky tram.  OHSU took on most of the cost of building it and said we'd be able to take it for the price of any tri-met ticket.  The city put up about 15% of the cost an then took on <a href=""http://www.portlandtribune.com/news/story.php?story_id=115828659093358400"">$170 million in civic projects to support it</a>.  Sinking it in sand, as they did, it cost more to build than they thought, so tickets are a whopping $4 -- more than twice the regular Tri-Met, tho I think you can get on the bus with your tram pass -- I'm not sure on that last point.

You should be able to get on the tram from the bermuda triangle, but you can't.  It seems nearly impossible to appproach this end of the tram with a car -- you need to take a streetcar from downtown to get anywhere near it.  Polly and I parked the car and walked all around, starting at the YMCA and endidng up blocked by Macadam.  There's no way across.  We tried to get on that thing for 2 hours, in the rain, to no avail.  To get back we had to cross two dark, high speed roads with no crosswalks, in the rain, at dusk.  Not safe!

You can't make poor city planning good by putting cool stuff on top of it where nothing permenant should be anyhow.  It drives me wild.

The OHSU building became another office building for the research hospital when it became clear that the bio-tech industry was getting along just fine in the cities it already called home.  I don't even think people who work there get free passes on the Tram.  Again, I'm not sure about that.

The city, who gave bags and bags of money to the project, built roads, crated new bus routes to serve it and redistricted it into a new neighborhood; is sunk in so deep, it can only ask OHSU to please lower its rates to the agreed upon amount.  The tram operations of OHSU just say, ""no.""  What can the city do? 

No floods yet this year.  The condos and the car-park tower are done now, and they just look sort of nervous sitting there.  

There have been plenty of sewage discharge events, since the big pipe isn't finished yet, but that, at least, is over on the Eastside and progressing.  In a few years, should they survive that long, underwater Portlanders in the South Waterfront won't have to watch human poo float by their windows when they do flood.

To its credit, the tram was the only public transit working when we had a recent ice and snow storm.","['2006', 'bad ideas', 'bridge', 'building', 'cityscape', 'climate change', 'cranes', 'flood plain', 'flooding', 'landscape', 'oregon', 'poor city planning', 'porltand landscape', 'portland', 'progress', 'river-walk', 'ross island bridge', 'south waterfront', 'sunset', 'vera katz memorial eastbank espanade', 'zip97201']",flood-flats,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,26084283@N00,jpg,,413426346,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1173253142,2006-09-09 19:24:21.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/26084283@N00/413426346/,sillydog,SONY DSC-F828

I had been out making some photos at Prasat Banteay Srei, and was on the way back to Siem Reap, when it started rain like hell, I took like 5 minutes for me to get soaking wet, even though I was sitting in the back of a tuk-tuk - with a roof over My head - after a while we passed some rice fields, and I made My tuk-tuk driver and friend Mab stop, because now that I was soaked anyway, I might as well get out in the rain and make some photos.
I ended up walking into the rice fields, to get some good angles.

But on My way back to the tuk-tuk, I saw these girls, getting on their bikes, I manage to get a few photos of them beck they went on their way.

I'll show you some of the rice field photos later on, when I get them processed.","['2012', 'asia', 'bike', 'bo nielsen', 'bo47', 'cambodia', 'done', 'geotag', 'girls', 'humans', 'nikkor 24-70mm f2.8', 'nikon d3s', 'people', 'pradak', 'rain', 'road', 'siem reap', 'smiling', 'street photography', 'wet', 'www.bonielsen.me', 'www.justwalkedby.com']",Smiling in the Rain,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,61932398@N00,jpg,103.936341,11464225774,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1387544782,2012-07-07 16:50:22.0,13.441736,http://www.flickr.com/photos/61932398@N00/11464225774/,Bo47,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D3S

"Anyone that’s fished with Morocco Carp on the mythical lake Bin el Ouidane will know that the walk down to our jetty and hotel bank swims can take the puff out of you. It was particularly hard work for our boat waiters who bring the breakfast and dinner and of course lug 100’s of kilos of equipment from the hotel down to the lake.
So in true pioneering fashion we decided to build a road! The new road will lead directly from the Morocco Carp HQ along the side of the river gulley and straight to our boat jetty. This will allow us to use our 2 quad motorbikes (also available for hire) with small trailers to transport the massive amounts of gear, bait and food.","['building', 'morocco', 'roads']",Hamid looks on,Attribution License,17544526@N00,jpg,,1396476103,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1190038294,2007-09-13 12:43:22.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/17544526@N00/1396476103/,radcarper,EASTMAN KODAK COMPANY KODAK EASYSHARE Z710 ZOOM DIGITAL CAMERA

"Das Rathaus am Marktplatz wurde 1277 erstmals als gimnasio vel theatro, also als Spiel- und Gerichtshaus erwähnt. Der ursprüngliche Bruchsteinbau wurde zwischen 1492 und 1498 um den aufgesetzten Fachwerkteil erweitert. Sein heutiges Aussehen erhielt es nach einem Brand (1521) und einem weiteren Umbau in den Jahren 1539 bis 1544. Besonders bemerkenswert sind die geschnitzten Figuren, mit denen die Geschoss- und Dachüberstände verziert sind. Es gilt als eines der schönsten Rathäuser Europas. Quelle: Wikipedia

The original stone  building was extended between 1492 and 1498 by the upper framework part. After a fire in the year 1521 and further changes in the years 1539 to 1544 the building received its current appearance. It is considered as one of the most beautiful town halls of Europe.

"The green metal constructions are new trackway parts which are ready for installation.

The dismantling of the Art Nouveau train shed (and the terminus station) has already begun. Both will soon be replaced with new structures which will look pretty much like the old ones.
This is part of a huge renovation project which started in 1995. The complete infrastructure of the 13.3 km long monorail line had to be replaced after 100 years of service. About 95% of this undertaking have already been finished. As of July 2012 the dismantling and reconstruction of the eastern terminus of the line has begun. This includes the renewal of the train shed with the storage sidings. The shed will be replaced by a modern construction which will be designed more or less in the traditional style. It will be much longer than the existing hall.","['af nikkor 28-105mm 1:3.5-4.5 d', 'af-d zoom-nikkor 3.5-4.5/28-105mm', 'bergisches land', 'deutschland', 'germany', 'nikon d90', 'nordrhein-westfalen', 'northrhine-westphalia', 'nrw', 'oberbarmen', 'wuppertal']",Wuppertal-Oberbarmen.

"The Janson Garage is a one and two-story simply detailed Commercial Brick former automobile garage and dealership building constructed in 1914-15 and expanded in 1933.  The original part of the L-plan building is narrow-fronted and deep with a two-story front and roof that slopes gently downward to the rear behind a stepped parapet on either side.  Its front is faced in dark red brick and sides and rear are constructed of yellow-buff brick.  The front contains a broad central entry – once an auto entry but now containing a double door with sidelights – flanked by two large shop windows on either side and a broad central and narrow side windows above that illuminate a shallow second-story space in the building’s front.  The small second story and sloping flat roof are supported by timber Howe trusses, with metal tie rods, spanning the building.  The one-story addition, originally fronted by three garage bays and a large window, adjoins the original garage, with its front set well back from the 1914-15 building’s front.  The addition’s front and sides are faced in buff brick, the rear in common red brick.","['architecture', 'automobile', 'charles g. janson', 'ford', 'historic preservation', 'history', 'hjalmer a. floodstrand', 'menominee', 'michigan']",Charles G.

Way to Oblivion *
Chinese Graveyard - Silom / Bangkok - August 2013.

Die Erinnerung ist dem Vergessen gewichen.

Irgendwo in der Nähe der zentralen Silom-Road in Bangkok,
umgeben von futuristischen Hochhäusern, Baustellen und dem Skytrain,
findet sich ein alter chinesischer Friedhof.
Während der Stadtteil sein Gesicht rasend schnell wandelte und
von scheinbar unablässiger Beschäftigkeit geprägt ist,
herrscht hier eine Atmosphäre des Stillstandes,
in der Vergangenheit verharrend. 
Schwergewichtige Grabsteine und 
Tempelartige Monumente prägen das Bild.
Gemeißelte Drachen und Löwen sollen die Verstorbenen beschützen.
Doch ihre Aufgabe haben inzwischen die Straßehunde übernommen,
die wachsam ihr Revier sichern.
Die Grabmahle sind längst dem Verfall preisgegeben, 
teilweise überflutet und verwildert.
Die Erinnerung ist dem Vergessen gewichen.

"The Tyldesley Loop line was opened by the London &v North West Railway Company on 1st September 1864, to provide a link between Eccles (located on the famous 1830 Stephenson line between Manchester and Liverpool), and Wigan (located on the main West Coast line which ran from London to Glasgow).
In 1870 an additional branch line (the Roe Green Loopline) was opened to Bolton, via Walkden Low Level. The station was initially opened at Walkden with Low Level being added 2.6.1924. A key function of the lines was to support the surrounding collieries in conjunction with the Bridgewater canal, the largest of which was at Mosley Common, one of the biggest pits in the UK at its prime.
The Tyldesley Loopline extended from Eccles, through Monton and Worsley to Roe Green, where it turned westwards through Ellenbrook. At Roe Green, the Roe Green Loopline diverted northwards through Walkden to Bolton. The Tyldesley Loopline was finally closed under the 'Beeching Axe' on 5th May 1969, when under the control of British Rail. The Roe Green branch line closed in October 1969.

Part of the closed routes have be reclaimed by Salford as part of a recreational network – the route via Ellenbrook being part of National Cycle Network 55.

TfGM is now building a guided busway from Ellensbrook south west of Walkden to Leigh using the old formation. Buses will operate a cross city service from the Oxford Road University and Hospitals complexes in Manchester via the city centre and Salford before joining the busway from the East Lances Road just west of Irlams o’th’ Height. Over the forty years the rail line was closed nature reclaimed the cuttings and embankments. Residents got used to using the route for walking dogs and sheletering their gardens. The first step in building the busway has been to clear the route of trees.
This has not gone down well with the neighbours.

This set will follow the progress of the construction of the busway and starts with a preliminary ramble from Walkden to Hough Lane. The route from Walden to Ellenbrook is not part of the busway but is include to give some sense of the natural growth that has occurred whilst the railway was shut.

We begin at Walkden Lower Station’s former site – looking north at the line from Eccles via Monton Green  to Bolton Great Moor Street via Walkden, Little Hulton and Plodder Lane.","['atherton', 'bus', 'bus rapid transit', 'east lancs road', 'ellenbrook', 'guided busway', 'leigh', 'london & north western railway', 'tfgm', 'tyldesley']",The Leigh Guided Busway.

The Hardee's in this photo is interesting in that it's a direct conversion of a <a href=""http://www.captainerniesshowboat.com/sandys"">Sandy's Hamburgers</a>. Sandy's, a McDonald's competitor, had its heyday in the 1960s. Beginning in the early '70s, the struggling franchise was bought and most of its burger stands turned into Hardee's.

The building was replaced in the 1980s by a larger one of the familiar generic Hardee's design (which today is an Indian restaurant).

COAT OF ARMS

The arms which are placed on this wall, are the property of H.M. Customs and formerly stood above the porch of the Port's Custom House, 20 South Quay, the adjacent building to this to the north, now the offices of the Great Yarmouth Port Authority.

The Arms are the English Royal Arms used since the accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 and show the arms for England with three gold lions passant guardant on a red background in the first and fourth quarters, the Arms for Scotland with a red lion rampant in the second quarter and a gold harp with white strings on a blue background for Ireland in the third quarter.

The arms were restored by the Great Yarmouth Port Authority, mounted on this wall and floodlit on 1993.

"Villa Arconati, detta anche il Castellazzo, è una delle ville storiche del Parco delle Groane, situata a Bollate, nella frazione Castellazzo di Bollate. Si tratta di un esempio di barocchetto lombardo settecentesco ed è monumento nazionale.

Fra gli oggetti più celebri che sono stati conservati nella villa ricordiamo il Codice Atlantico di Leonardo da Vinci (donato da Galeazzo Arconati nel 1637 alla Biblioteca Ambrosiana, dove si trova tuttora) e i bassorilievi del monumento funebre a Gaston de Foix, scolpiti da Agostino Busti detto il Bambaja (forse discepolo dello stesso Leonardo), ora ai Musei Civici del Castello Sforzesco di Milano.
Attualmente vi si trova la Statua romana di Pompeo Magno. Donata della Santa Sede a Galeazzo Arconati, fu portata da Roma nel 1627, su un carro trainato da buoi. Si crede che sia questa la statua ai cui piedi morì, trafitto dalle pugnalate dei congiurati, Gaio Giulio Cesare nel 44 a.C.

Past Arese on the Milan-Varese main road, there is the vast castle estate at the centre of which, set in a beautiful alley is the Villa Arconati. The villa was built in the 17th century, by Galeazzo Arconati on a former medieval site and in 1730 it was rebuilt according to the plans of Giovanni Ruggeri. Around the splendid H-shaped villa are the Baroque gardesns, which represent one of Lombardy's best examples of landscape gardening. The water lilies, the animals, the woods, the reserves, the shaped hedges, make these splendid gardens a jewel of neoclassicism.","['ancient', 'anticando', 'archaeology', 'bollate', 'borgo', 'canon', 'castellazzo', 'castellazzo di bollate', 'codice atlantico', 'countryside', 'da vinci', 'gardens', 'giulio cesare', 'italian', 'italy', 'leonardo', 'milan', 'milano', 'nature', 'nikon', 'northern', 'old', 'pompeo magno', 'roman statue', 'sculpture', 'villa arconati']",VILLA ARCONATI d2x 111,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,34018447@N08,jpg,,3911466727,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1252754561,2008-04-19 11:20:40.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/34018447@N08/3911466727/,Giannux,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D2X

"Carter Lake, IA.  The only part of Iowa that actually resides on the Nebraska side of the Missouri river.

It is a city surrounded on three sides by Omaha, Nebraska, and its fourth boundary is the Missouri River. The oxbow shaped lake is approximately 323 acres with the city being approximately 1,236 acres.

In 1853, Edmond Jefferies filed a claim on 30 acres of land, which today is known as Carter Lake, Iowa. During the next 14 years, the Missouri River slowly shifted its channel, enlarging Mr. Jefferies' original 30 acres into 78 acres.

In 1877, flooding and shifting of the Missouri River created an oxbow lake, originally called Cut-Off lake and later Lake Nakomis, and left about 2,000 acres belonging to the State of Iowa, bounded on three sides by the State of Nebraska.

After extensive litigation between Iowa and Nebraska, in 1892 the United States Supreme Court finally ruled that Carter Lake belonged to Iowa (145 U.S. 519).

In 1930, Carter Lake became an officially incorporated city in the State of Iowa and today the Missouri River has stabilized.

Today, Carter Lake continues to grow and thrive paradoxically, as a small Iowa community surrounded by Omaha, Nebraska.

"Warren Street tube station is a London Underground station. It is on the Charing Cross branch of the Northern Line, between Goodge Street and Euston, and the Victoria Line between Oxford Circus and Euston.

The station opened as part of the original Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway on June 22, 1907 under the name ""Euston Road"", and this name can still be seen in the Northern Line platform tiling. The station's name changed to ""Warren Street"" the following year. The current station building replaced the original when escalators were installed. The Victoria Line platforms opened on December 1, 1968.","['london', 'metro', 'public', 'subway', 'train', 'transport', 'tube', 'underground']",Warren Street,Attribution-NoDerivs License,42907325@N00,jpg,-0.138165,3508736120,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/,1241644579,2009-03-22 15:16:31.0,51.524695,http://www.flickr.com/photos/42907325@N00/3508736120/,OliverN5,Sony Ericsson K800i

Info:

A covered bridge is a bridge with enclosed sides and a roof, often accommodating only a single lane of traffic. They have typically been wooden, although some newer ones are concrete or metal with glass sides. Mainly associated with the nineteenth century, covered bridges often serve as prominent local landmarks and have long attracted the attention of historic preservationists.

Such bridges are found in rural areas throughout the United States and Canada, but are often threatened by arsonists, vandals, and flooding. In the United States, Pennsylvania has more covered bridges (over 200) than any other state, many of which can be seen in Bedford, Somerset, Washington, Chester and Lancaster Counties. The U.S. states of Vermont and New Hampshire have more covered bridges per square mile than any other place in the world. Oregon has the largest number of historical covered bridges in the western United States. They are also common in places such as Elizabethton, Tennessee; Lane County, Oregon; Madison County, Iowa; Parke County, Indiana; and Blount County, Alabama. Parts of California, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky, Maryland, Minnesota, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and the New England states have surviving covered bridges.

Franconia Notch State Park is located in the White Mountains in northern New Hampshire and straddles 8 miles (13 km) of Interstate 93 as it passes through Franconia Notch, a mountain pass between the Kinsman Range and Franconia Range. Attractions in the state park include the Flume Gorge and visitor center, the Old Man of the Mountain historical site, fishing in Echo Lake and Profile Lake, and miles of hiking, biking and ski trails.
The park is also home to Cannon Mountain, a state-owned ski resort started in the 1930s. The mountain is named for a rock formation in the shape of a cannon found on the summit, but the ""Old Man of the Mountain"" formation was by far the more famous; it collapsed in May of 2003. Cannon is also famous for being one of the most challenging hills in New England. It boasts an aerial tram, which runs year-round, ferrying sightseers to the summit in the summer time and skiers in the winter. At the base of the tramway is the New England Ski Museum, with exhibits on the history of alpine skiing in New England and America.
On the west side of the notch, halfway up the side of Cannon Mountain, is Lonesome Lake, an easy day hike up the Lonesome Lake Trail from the state park's Lafayette Place campground. The Lonesome Lake Hut, one of numerous well-kept huts throughout the White Mountains that are maintained by the Appalachian Mountain Club, is found at the southwest end of the lake, near its outlet. Huts offer meals and lodging (reservations are recommended).
Opposite Cannon Mountain, on the east side of the notch, are the Eagle Cliffs, so named for the eagles that sometimes roost there. The Greenleaf Trail, a hiking trail, winds around the south side of the cliff and up to Greenleaf Hut, another AMC hut. East of Greenleaf Hut and outside of the state park is the 5,249-foot (1,600 m) summit of Mount Lafayette and the Franconia Ridge Trail (also the Appalachian Trail). The Appalachian Trail continues north to Mount Washington and eventually to Mount Katahdin in Maine.
Beneath a waterfall in the Pemigewasset River is a granite pothole about 20 feet (6 m) across known simply as ""the Basin"". It was scrubbed out by stones dragged (and eventually deposited) by the retreating North American ice sheet, and since made smooth by 15 millennia of rapidly whirling pebbles and grit. Below the Basin is ""Old Man's Foot"", a distinctively shaped rock formation, also the natural result of Pemigewasset's erosive energy.

"On our last day of this incredible journey we hike to Whitney Portal, then drive to Lone Pine, the small town on Route 395 that is the ""entrance"" to the climb of Mt. Whitney from the east side.

The packs are light, gravity is in our favor, and the air is getting thicker. We are feeling great, although a bit sad that the adventure is about to be over. Our minds wander, and I can't help but wonder where Lone Pine gets its name from. My eyes become attracted to all the lone pines out there! 

From the Lone Pine Chamber of Commerce site:
""The town of Lone Pine is named after the lonely pine tree that was found at the mouth of Lone Pine Canyon. The town was founded during the 1860's to provide supplies to the local gold and silver mining communities of Kearsarge, Cerro Gordo and Darwin, and later to farmers and ranchers.

The pine tree has long since vanished, destroyed in flood.""

"The Akua Granda (also spelled Aqua Granda) is the ancient name of Livigno's main river. It is now called Spöl, although this name designates the river after it crosses the Swiss border.

Despite being in Italy, Akua Granda is a tributary of the Inn, and the Danube, and not of the Po river. In other words, this valley is on the northern side of the Alps' watershed. In this area geographical and political boundaries do not coincide.

Due to an international treaty, an artificial lake, Lago di Livigno, was created by Engadiner Kraftwerke in the 1960s, with a dam on the border. This caused the flooding of part of the ancient village of Livigno. Despite indemnisation, not all inhabitants were willing to leave this part of the valley.

The reservoir has a capacity of 164 million m³ (approx. 215 million cubic yards). Its minimum and maximum water levels above sea level are at 1,700 metres (5,577 ft)and 1,805 metres (5,922 ft) respectively. Since its construction, this lake had been off-limits for any activity, such as wind-surfing or rowing, until the summer of 2005, when Italy's National Rowing team was authorized to train on the lake. For the benefits of altitude training please visit the relevant entry.

The same international treaty allowed another electricity company, AEM (www.aem.it) to catch the waters of Akua Granda and other tributaries above a certain altitude and to transport it through a tunnel to the artificial lakes of Cancano, in Val Fraele, on the other side of the watershed. This has decreased the water level on the river dramatically, with some parts of it left without water, causing strong but ineffective protests by the local population.

Nowadays this river is popular for fishing, virtually the only other use which can be made out of it.","['alps', 'aqua granda', 'danube', 'danubio', 'fiume', 'livigno', 'mountain', 'river', 'spöl', 'torrente', 'water']",Spöl,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,16581899@N07,jpg,10.146002,6125223616,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1315429935,2011-08-24 17:14:26.0,46.552353,http://www.flickr.com/photos/16581899@N07/6125223616/,Umberto Fistarol,Canon EOS 50D

"The only house I know of in Danville that was washed away by the recent flooding. All that is left is the raised foundation and debris.

*Correction 9/14/11- I found out the house burned while it was flooded.  Apparently the house caught fire while the flood waters were up to the top of the foundation.  The water went higher and washed away most of the burnt debris.

Strobist info:
After about 20 minutes experimenting I came up with this- it is roughly a 30 second exposure with ambient light from a nearly full moon, and side lighting from a car's headlights through trees as it traveled towards the house along the road for roughly 20 of those seconds, and finally two pops from a handheld SB600 at 1/64 power and 85mm zoom using the test button from about 30 feet away from the structure on either side of the camera.","['2011', 'burnt', 'county', 'damage', 'danville', 'disaster', 'exposure', 'fire', 'flash', 'flood', 'foundation', 'headlights', 'house', 'light', 'long', 'montour', 'natural', 'night', 'pa', 'painting', 'remains', 'river', 'strobist', 'suquehanna', 'township', 'valley']",Washed Away,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,25187922@N05,jpg,-76.583805,6143103084,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1315890725,2011-09-12 21:25:18.0,40.943083,http://www.flickr.com/photos/25187922@N05/6143103084/,mgstyer,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D40

Elbe Tunnel (1911)

Old Elbe Tunnel or St. Pauli Elbe Tunnel (German: Alter Elbtunnel (coll.) or St. Pauli Elbtunnel (official name)) which opened in 1911, is a pedestrian and vehicle tunnel in Hamburg, Germany. The 426 m (1,398 ft) long tunnel was a technical sensation; 24 m (80 ft) beneath the surface, two tubes with 6 m (20 ft) diameter connect central Hamburg with the docks and shipyards on the south side of the river Elbe. This meant a big improvement for tens of thousands of workers in one of the busiest harbours in the world.

Four huge lifts on either side of the tunnel carried pedestrians, carriages and motor vehicles to the bottom. They are still in operation, though due to the limited capacity by today's standards, other bridges and tunnels have been built and taken over most of the traffic.

In 2008 approx 300.000 cars, 63.000 bicycles and 700.000 pedestrians used the tunnel. The tunnel is opened 24 hours for pedestrians and bicycles. For motorized vehicles opening times are currently Monday to Friday from 5.20 AM to 8.00 PM, on Saturdays from 5.20 AM to 4.00 PM.

HistoryOn July 22, 1907 the construction of the tunnel started to connect the quarters of St. Pauli near the Landungsbrücken and Steinwerder.

Work was done under pressure because the tunnel was below the water table of the Elbe. This type of building technique was used in the 19th century, in large engineering excavations, such as with the piers of bridges and with tunnels, where caissons under pressure were used to keep water from flooding the excavations, such as the foundations of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York.

But workers who spend time in high-pressure atmospheric pressure conditions are at risk when they return to the lower pressure outside the caisson without slowly reducing the surrounding pressure. Due to the problems associated with decompression sickness, many of the men working on the Elbe tunnel were affected by, what was known at the time, Caisson's Disease. Three men died, 74 suffered severe cases and more than 600 came down with light symptoms among 4,400 workers.

The tunnel opened on September 7, 1911.

[edit] Modern usageIn the tunnel an art exhibition (ElbArt (German)) and a long-distance running event Elbtunnel-Marathon (website of the organiser (German)) are taking place.[1] In 2008 the tunnel participated in the Tag des offenen Denkmals (Day of the open heritage site), a Germany-wide annual event sponsored by the Deutsche Stiftung Denkmalschutz, that opens cultural heritage sites to the public.[2]

"The Venetian Lagoon is a lagoon off the Adriatic Sea in which the city of Venice is situated.

The Venetian Lagoon has a surface area of around 550km2. It is around 8% land, including Venice itself and many smaller islands. About 11% is permanently water, or canal as the dredged channels are called, while around 80% is mud flats and salt marshes.

It is connected to the Adriatic Sea by three inlets: Lido Inlet, Malamocco Inlet and Chioggia Inlet. Being at the end of a closed sea, the Lagoon is subject to high variations in water level, the most extreme being the spring tides known as the acqua alta (Italian for ""high waters""), which regularly flood much of Venice.","['italy', 'sea', 'torcello', 'trees']",Burano (2006-05-648),Attribution License,97189870@N00,jpg,12.419397,322178679,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1166104161,2006-05-18 15:21:26.0,45.498086,http://www.flickr.com/photos/97189870@N00/322178679/,Argenberg,"OLYMPUS IMAGING CORP.

"As the years went by, the neighborhood went to rack and ruin. The city foreclosed on 34 West 94th Street, an abandoned building. At an auction in 1968, Mr Roland Karlen rescued this marvelous old building from the wrecking ball. He rehabilitated it, and he lived in it for more than 40 years, returning it to its former glory. He recently sold the venerable old building to Columbia Grammar and Preparatory School for about $8 million. What a fantastic comeback! The gargoyle above the front door continues to impart wisdom to the neighborhood, and I am sure that he will delight the new crop of school children who will soon be studing here.

"Area to be impacted by the proposed Tipaimukh Dam. Communities in both Manipur State (northeast India) and Bangladesh have resisted the proposed Tipaimukh Dam on the Barak River. The 163-meter dam has sparked controversy in both countries over India’s failure to provide public consultations and information sharing with both Bangladesh and indigenous communities. The Indian state-owned utility North East Electric Power Corporation Ltd. (NEEPCO) originally built the dam to control floods but now plans to generate electricity with the dam, which has a capacity of 1500 MW. Most of the electricity would be sold to cities outside the region.

"Waterloo Bridge is a road traffic and pedestrian bridge crossing the River Thames in London, between Blackfriars Bridge and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/wallyg/302718922"">Hungerford Bridge</a>. The name of the bridge is in memory of the British victory at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815. Thanks to its location at a strategic bend in the river, the views of London from the bridge are widely held to be the finest from any spot at ground level.

The first bridge on the site was designed by John Rennie and opened in 1817 as a toll bridge. The granite bridge had nine arches, each of 120' span, and was 2,456' long, including approaches. Before its opening it was known as 'Strand Bridge'. It was nationalised in 1878 and given to the Metropolitan Board of Works, who removed the toll from it. Serious problems were found in its construction and the new owners reinforced it. Paintings of the bridge were created by the French Impressionist Claude Monet and English Impressionist, John Constable.

By the 1920s the problems had increased. London County Council decided to demolish it and replace it with a new structure designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott. The new span was partially opened in 1942 and completed in 1945, and was the only Thames bridge to have been damaged by German bombers during World War II. The building contractor was Peter Lind & Company Limited and it is popularly believed the work force was largely female.  Despite there being no contemporary evidence to support this, the bridge is still affectionately referred to as ""the women's bridge."" It is constructed in Portland stone from the South West of England; the stone cleans itself whenever it rains in London.","['bridge', 'britain', 'england', 'europe', 'giles gilbert scott', 'great britain', 'lambeth', 'london', 'londonist', 'pedestrian bridge', 'river', 'river thames', 'sir giles gilbert scott', 'south bank', 'thames', 'thames river', ""the women's bridge"", 'uk', 'united kingdom', 'waterloo bridge']",UK - London - South Bank: Waterloo Bridge,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,70323761@N00,jpg,-0.116381,302716859,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1164112907,2006-11-09 09:00:31.0,51.507794,http://www.flickr.com/photos/70323761@N00/302716859/,wallyg,Canon PowerShot SD600

"HARTWELL, Ga. -- Water rushes through 12 spillway gates at the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Hartwell Dam in the early morning hours of July 9, 2013. The Corps activated the spillway gates to release excess water after heavy rainfall the night before caused the reservoir to reach its maximum flood storage capacity of 665 feet per mean sea level. During peak discharge, the Corps released 74,000 cubic feet per second (cfs) of water through the Hartwell Dam. This amount includes 32,000 cfs passing through the five turbines (for hydropower generation) and 42,000 cfs passing through 12 spillway gates. Other than routine spillway gate tests, it was the first time the spillway gates had been opened at the Hartwell Dam since Aug. 18, 1994. The only other occasion was on March 8, 1964.

"Oakdale Dam, located a few miles south of Monticello, Indiana, was completed in 1925 forming Lake Freeman, thus the framework was set for the twin lakes area to become one of the largest summer vacation spots in the Midwest. Construction on Oakdale began in 1924 and was completed a year later on the Tippecanoe River. This allowed the waters of Shafer Lake, formed earlier by the opening of Norway Dam in June 1923, to flood the lowland areas and create scenic Lake Freeman. The run-of-the-river dams were built by a power company during the ""Roaring 20s"". They are owned by the Northern Indiana Public Service Co., which has operated the two hydroelectric facilities since 1944. Until the end of World War II, the two power generating stations produced sufficient power to accommodate the energy demands of Monticello, and enough extra power for export to other areas of the state. With the baby boom and unprecedented economic growth after World War II in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the utility company was forced to turn to other means to meet the energy demands of this area. While there are larger lakes in the state, the man-made lakes of Freeman and Shafer are unequaled anywhere in Indiana because the two run-of-the-river dams maintain a nearly constant water level in the lakes throughout the year. More than 100 camps, resorts and other commercial enterprises are located around the two lakes, in addition to the more than 1,000 year-around homes, numerous summer cottages and mobile homes. Between Memorial Day and Labor Day the influx of summer residents and visitors to area multiples area population several times. Tourism alone is said to generate an estimated $70 million annually in retail sales and services, making tourism one of White County's economic cornerstones.

"The remains of the tabularium are visible at the base of the Capitoline Hill (grey construction); the building served as the repository for Rome's records. If the identification is correct, the structure was built during the consulship of Q. Lutatius Catulus in 78 BCE, or perhaps shortly afterwards.  The gray stone is of tuff (specifically Gabine stone, or ""sperone"")  The columns blocking an unimpeded view of the Tabularium are, on the left foreground: Temple of Castor, on the left background, Temple of Saturn, and on right center, the Temple of the Deified Vespasian (and Titus).

For comments on the date and Catulus see also:
Ryan, F. X. Rank and Participation in the Republican Senate (1998) p. 304, n. 79; who suggests that the completion date could range from 78 BCE to as late as 62 or 61 BCE.

"<a target=""blank"" href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_McHenry"">Fort McHenry</a>, Baltimore Harbor, Maryland, USA - During the attack on September 13, 1814 which inspired ""The Star-Apangled Banner,"" this moat was filled with Marines, in full battle gear. They were ready to protect the fort from a land attack. This photo was taken from the top a a wall similar to what you see here. The enemy would have to scale this wall (with defenders on top), drop down into the moat, fight their way across to the other side, and scale that wall, which was also defended from above. Turns out, there weren't enough British marines on the ships to mount a large enough assault. They were turned back by other land action before they arrived at the fort's land entry.

The flag pole here is an exact replica of the one Francis Scott Key saw. The flag, however, is a standard mid-sixed military issue one. The full-sized banner is only flown during special celebrations. Fort McHenry is one of the only locations authorized by an act of Congress where the flag is flown at all times, and is the only location designated both a National Monument and a National Historic Shrine.","['baltimore', 'federal fort', 'fort mchenry', 'maryland', 'md', 'old building']",MD - dry moat and flag pole,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,28638766@N00,jpg,-76.579878,20388278,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1119239664,2005-06-02 16:09:29.0,39.263202,http://www.flickr.com/photos/28638766@N00/20388278/,tsmyther,"Minolta Co., Ltd.

"J.H. Ashdown Warehouse, now residences, 167 Bannatyne Avenue - architects:  S.F. Peters, 1895; J.H.G. Russell, 1899, 1902, 1906, 1908, 1911 

Built by Winnipeg’s “Merchant Prince” in 1895, the J.H. Ashdown Warehouse, remains a major urban landmark in the Exchange District. When the first portion of the massive warehouse was built, Ashdown was at the mid-point of an illustrious career that had made him a fortune. He had a major influence on the development of Winnipeg from its incorporation until his death sixty years later.

Starting out in a local tinsmith shop, Ashdown’s business grew along with the settlement.  In 1870 he purchased two lots on the corner of Main Street and Bannatyne Avenue, the location of the Ashdown retail store for over one hundred years. Ashdown’s successful real estate speculation, combined with his business acumen, made him a millionaire by 1910.

With his business prospering, Ashdown commissioned architect S. Frank Peters in 1894 to design a warehouse at the corner of Bannatyne and Rorie Street. This location expanded the boundary of the warehouse district, which had been contained west of Main Street. The original warehouse was only three storeys high and five bays wide, built with brick and stone using little ornamentation in a Romanesque style. The building opened in January, 1896 and at some point between 1896 and 1900, the fourth floor was added above the arches. 

Ashdown lobbied and successfully obtained a court decision permitting the building of a rail spur line that ensured goods could be delivered as well as shipped directly from his warehouse in boxcars. The spur line attracted other wholesalers to move into the area.

Ashdown’s wholesale enterprise prospered with the settlement in the west and the rapid expansion of the wheat economy. The warehouse was given two additional storeys in 1902 and a three-bay, six storey addition was made to the western end of the building in 1906. In 1911, the final three bays were added to the western side.

Throughout the years Ashdown’s Warehouse supplied every conceivable kind of merchandise, including its own “Diamond A Brand” goods. Ashdown also had small warehouses in Calgary, Saskatoon, Edmonton and Regina.  James H. Ashdown died in 1924, but the firm remained a family business until it was sold in 1971.

"Sometimes in endurance events competitors are confronted with terrifying water hazards. In serious events like the North Face 100 or those creepy ultra-marathons, competitors just run straight through. It’s appalling. 

The more delicate amongst us, without the benefit of a lucrative shoe sponsorship contract, mostly go through a more tedious ritual, carried out with increasing degrees of difficulty the longer you’ve been on the trail: sit down, remove shoes, remove socks, wade across, dry off, put socks back on (if you can), put shoes back on (if you can) stand up (if you can), continue on your journey. It may take 10 minutes; it may take 20.

But in our team, we’re smarter than that. We’re trialling a new high velocity, high performance, water repelling, super non-absorbent, secret-formula, nano-membrane technology; it even comes in a choice of attractive colours. And it works!

"Over the weekend trip to Yosemite, I got an opportunity to witness one of the most unique set of scenes in the valley - that of the moonrise over the high Sierras and the subsequent flooding of the valley with pure white moonlight.

As I was heading back from <a href=""http://www.yosemitepark.com/badgerpass.aspx"">Badger Pass</a> after a 7 mile snowshoe to <a href=""http://www.yosemitehikes.com/glacier-point-road/dewey-point/dewey-point.htm"">Dewey Point</a>, I just happened to pass by the famous <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunnel_View"">Tunnel View</a> a few minutes after sunset. 

It just so happened that this was the exact time the moon was also starting to rise. It came up from behind El Capitan. The vestiges of twilight managed to light up the shadowed side of the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/sathishcj/2379773480/"">stoic rock</a> while the entire valley bathed in the moonlight slowly and steadily rising up.

It was quite a dramatic and unique scene - something that I have never ever witnessed before.

The extra spot of light near the half dome was caused by internal reflection in the prime lens.

"6448.  With the wind blowing hard on a grey Sydney day - the southern edges of a tropical storm that had brought massive flooding to northern Australia - the Oliver Hazard Perry/ Adelaide Class frigate HMAS  SYDNEY [IV] makes a turn off the HMAS SYDNEY [I] fighting top memorial on Bradley's Head in Sydney Harbour. 

It's a lovely image, full of atmosphere and weather, taken by John Darroch  of the Sydney Heritage Fleet organisation - and from a homebound Mosman ferry we are guessing.  However, Geoff Eastwood, who has kindly passed John's photo on to us, says the symbolic synergy of the missile frigate and the famous WWI namesake's memorial is entirely accidental.   John had sent the photo to Geoff  for ship identification, not realizing her had put the two SYDNEYS, I and IV together.

Nonetheless, well done John. 

We were wondering why SYDNEY [IV] is dressed ship here - and had concluded that it must have been from her role as flagship of the 177th sailing of Sydney's famous Australia Day Regatta, which had been held three days earlier. We noticed SYDNEY has awnings spread on the quarter deck here - but our assumption about the Regatta role was incorrect. The ship was celebrating it's 30th birthday since commissioning on Feb. 29, 1983. As follows ... 

IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN COM,MENTS BELOW;  From John Lyall

Jeff [Kookaburra],
This photo was taken last Tuesday 29th, the reason the ship was Dressed is that it was its 30th Birthday. Some of the commissioning crew, about 120 had a cocktail party onboard on the night with members of the current crew. The next night they had a dinner cruise on Sydney Harbour, brought back a lot of memories for my brother and was great to catch up with guys he hadn't seen for years,
John

Many thanks John.
 
By the way  the Australia Day Regatta this year  [2013] attracted more than 700 entrants and was  won by the newly-restored GRETEL II,  the famous wooden 12m yacht that contested the America's Cup as Australia's first challenger, owned by  Sir Frank Packer, in 1970. In the U.S. she lost 4-1 to the New York Yacht Club's defender INTREPID,  but set up the questing spirit that led to Australia eventually becoming the first-ever successful America's Cup challenger with the victory of Alan Bond's AUSTRALIA II syndicate in 1983.

This is a very big image, by the way. We think the little tugboat's name is WATTLE [that would be WATTLE II, of course, the original WATTLE being now at Victoria Harbour in Melbourne]. Also note the HMAS SYDNEY name board on the rock face on the shore, behind the Grecian-type column at the waterside, and SYDNEY'S ensign streaming in the wind above.

"Opened as an iron tabernacle in 1891 it was replaced by a permanent church and halls in 1901. A schoolroom was registered in 1900.

Originally sponsored by the Caledonian Road circuit of the Primitive Methodists, the church joined the Finsbury Park circuit after the Methodists’ union in 1931.

Peeking through the door, one Sunday in 1903, when membership was rising and Mattison Road was described as the chief Primitive Methodist church in London, you could have counted 188 devotees in the morning and 240 in the evening.

A minister was shared with Grange Park from 1931 to 1942 and thereafter with Finsbury Park. Closed in 1963 it became a Roman Catholic church until its closure in 2009. Its next incarnation is uncertain although locals have many ideas for it.","['church', 'harringay', 'mattison road', 'new river', 'st augustines', 'victorian']","St Augustines, Harringay overlooking the New River",Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,24658806@N02,jpg,-0.102138,3840233887,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1250802478,2009-08-19 13:27:39.0,51.579763,http://www.flickr.com/photos/24658806@N02/3840233887/,MrsEds,Canon DIGITAL IXUS 970 IS

"24 hours prior to when this was photographed, floodwaters of the Skokomish River, Washington State, filled this field and were flowing over the road from left to right. The actual river is approximately 1000 yards from my camera position, running along the ridge in the background and perpendicular to the road. I am looking due north from this point.

Camera height is 40 feet.

As you can see, there are barbed wire fences that run parallel to the road on both sides. You can see the grass and debris that has got hung up on these fences when the water was flowing past them. What also got caught in the barbed wire were salmon, these can be seen in the detail photos.

We are lucky enough to have this spot a 15 minute drive away from home. :-)

Just another in my series of shots of this superb building through the seasons - today, apart from the surrounding bird songs we were 'entertained' by the resident (one-eyed) cat chasing a field mouse around the gardens - I believe it was 1-0 to the field mouse ....

One of our favourite places to be on a cracking afternoon.

The building was used during WWII as a garrison for locally based fighter pilots, and there are photos of this period on the walls - a wonderfully old fashioned air to this spot that makes it a gorgeous place to sit and relax - beer or cream teas are optional :-)

"The oddest thing about this inundation of the reserve is that, restricted to the small car park, I picked up nearly 30 species in half an hour. Two previous visits to <a href=""http://thepokerbird.com/2012/white-rumped-sandpiper-steart"" rel=""nofollow"">Greylake</a> hadn't yielded half as many, although 2012 did provide spotted crake.
Can we infer that floods are good for birds? Buzzards were plentiful and I guess they'll have plenty of carrion when (if!) the waters recede. A female marsh harrier also flapped her languid way over the drenched fields. Teal, wigeon, little egrets, swans, herons, coots and of course mallards were predictable waterbirds.
Passerines though also abounded, maybe attracted by a wee feeding station. I had redwings, fieldfares and the year's first reed buntings among the usual suspects. A blackcap also chacked away, invisible in a stunted tree, and as I left, a Cetti's warbler fired up.
True, my earlier visits were in June and September and one may expect more of February at a wetland site. But it was very wet. I drove on to <a href=""http://thepokerbird.com/2011/secret-world-secret-somerset"" rel=""nofollow"">Burrowbridge</a> and the end of the A361 under these conditions – all a contrast from three summers ago. I'd hoped to go up the Mump to survey the scene but the car park was packed. Instead I got my view later from the A39 over the <a href=""http://thepokerbird.com/2011/apart-from-all-the-drama"" rel=""nofollow"">Polden Hills</a>. I'd have to say that the floods' extent looked similar to just over a year ago.
[caption width=""240"" align=""alignleft""]<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/16376452@N03/12717240403/""></a> Somerset Levels south from Greylake[/caption]So why the fuss this time? Let's face it: the <a href=""http://thepokerbird.com/2013/pied-billed-grebe-rspb-ham-wall"" rel=""nofollow"">Somerset Levels</a> flood; residents should deal with it or get out. Why should taxpayers' money go to ruining the area's character with concrete defences and 24/7 dredging machinery?
In contrast the area round <a href=""http://thepokerbird.com/2014/water-world"" rel=""nofollow"">Shapwick Heath</a>, further north, wasn't as aquatic as on Christmas Day. And the birds were still good: two kingfishers, a great egret, the year's first pintail and gadwall (really?) and one hopeful bittern already booming. At dusk a massive flock of perhaps 100,000 starlings crossed in the distance over <a href=""http://thepokerbird.com/2010/spotted-flycatcher-rspb-ham-wall"" rel=""nofollow"">Ham Wall</a> but Lord knows where they ended up. Many observers were out for the sight but none had tracked down the roost.
Well, the year list is now stuttering along. I'm tempted to beat my UK month record this coming March, just for the hell of it.

"Also dieser Urlaub wird wohl als einer der verregnetsten in unsere persönliche Urlaubshistorie eingehen. Der gestrige Tag fing schon mit Donnergrollen an. Zudem wurde es gar nicht richtig hell. Da wir es so geplant hatten, fuhren wir mit dem Auto nach Giardini-Naxos. Hier standen schon die ersten Straßen unter Wasser. Aber der Regen wieder auf und wir konnten mit dem Zug weiter nach Catania reisen, auf dem Fischmarkt einkaufen und eine Kleinigkeit essen. Die Rückfahrt war dann wirklich aufregend: es schüttete wie aus Eimern und irgendwann konnte man nicht mal mehr die Gleise sehen. In Fiumefreddo war dann die Fahrt zu Ende: Ziel knapp verfehlt. Der Lokführer, der Zugbegleiter und der Bahnhofsvorsteher waren dann sehr beschäftigt mit telefonieren und (ganz wichtig) gestikulieren. Wie es weitergeht wusste trotz der enormen Anstrengungen niemand. Aus einer halben Stunde Wartezeit wurde eine dann zwei bis wir nach zweieinhalb Stunden an der Piazza einen Taxistand aufsuchten, der nicht besetzt war. Zum Glück befand sich in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft eine Infosäule. Es gab jedoch ein winzig kleines Problem: es stand nichts d'rauf. Da hilft nur, zu improvisieren, worin der Sizilianer ein wahrer Meister zu sein scheint: Ein eiligst angesprochener Passant bittet einen Dritten, das Problem zu lösen. Da telefonisch kein Taxifahrer zu motivieren war, entschloss sich der Dritte kurzerhand, uns selbst zu fahren. Ende gut, alles gut. Da bleibt mir nur zu sagen:„Mille grazie.“","['überschwemmung', 'bahnhof', 'fiumefreddo', 'flood', 'italien', 'italy', 'sicily', 'sizilien', 'station']",Was war das denn?,Attribution License,41319826@N05,jpg,15.205835,3928181099,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1253192618,2009-09-16 14:03:55.0,37.795161,http://www.flickr.com/photos/41319826@N05/3928181099/,ch staudinger,Sony Ericsson K600i

In the 1960s a movie set was constructed in front of the colorful mesas, creating a picturesque setting for photographers until the set was washed away by a flood in the 1990s. A group of volunteers reconstructed some of the buildings, but they were razed by an arsonist in 2005.

"England's Finest Medieval Village.

Discover Lavenham; England's finest medieval village and food capital of Suffolk.
Lavenham has wonderful places to stay, restaurants and pubs with excellent food and interesting shops and galleries.
An ideal place to stay for a short break to explore Suffolk's countryside and coast.

Lavenham is a village and civil parish in Suffolk, England. It is noted for its 15th century church, half-timbered medieval cottages and circular walk. In the medieval period it was among the 20 wealthiest settlements in England. Currently, it is a popular day-trip destination for British people from across the country and Americans from the air bases of Lakenheath and Mildenhall, along with another historic wool town in the area, Long Melford.

For four centuries, Lavenham made its fortune from the wool trade, selling blue broadcloth, 'Lavenham Blues'  -  everywhere from Africa to the Baltic. By 1524, the town, its population just 2,000, was 14th richest in England, ahead of York and Lincoln.

The church of St. Peter & St. Paul, Lavenham. A very grand parish church dating from the 15th Century it was paid for by several rich Lavenham clothiers and the Lord of the Manor. It was built on the site of an earlier church and the present building is of the late perpendicular style. 
With the Church Tower clearly visible on the Suffolk Skyline, this church can be seen for miles around. Once a year it is open to the public. Well worth climbing the 200 steps to the top!

An ideal place to start a historic Potter trail, the medieval town of Lavenham was where it all began for Harry Potter in the Deathly Hallows, after deciding it had an ""ethereal"" quality. Lavenham stars as Harry’s childhood village of Godrick’s Hollow - the scene where his parents fell foul to the Dark Lord, and the epic battle began.","['200', '2011', '400d', 'annual', 'buildings', 'canon', 'canon eos 400d', 'church', 'climb', 'east anglia', 'england', 'europe', 'great britain', 'image', 'july', 'karen roe', 'lavenham', 'magnificent', 'medieval', 'photo', 'photograph', 'photography', 'picture', 'picturesque', 'suffolk', 'timber', 'tower', 'uk', 'views', 'village']",Lavenham & Church Tower Open Day 06-08-2011,Attribution License,28752865@N08,jpg,0.795135,6130540999,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1315597043,2011-08-06 15:12:52.0,52.107875,http://www.flickr.com/photos/28752865@N08/6130540999/,Karen Roe,Canon EOS 400D DIGITAL

"U Bein Bridge is a crossing that spans the Taungthaman Lake near Amarapura in Myanmar. The 1.2-kilometre (0.75 mi) bridge was built around 1850 and is believed to be the oldest and longest teakwood bridge in the world. Construction began when the capital of Ava Kingdom moved to Amarapura, and the bridge is named after the mayor who had it built.[5] It is used as an important passageway for the local people and has also become a tourist attraction and therefore a significant source of income for souvenir sellers. It is particularly busy during July and August when the lake is at its highest.
The bridge was built from wood reclaimed from the former royal palace in Inwa. It features 1,086 pillars that stretch out of the water, some of which have been replaced with concrete. Though the bridge largely remains intact, there are fears that an increasing number of the pillars are becoming dangerously decayed. Some have become entirely detached from their bases and only remain in place because of the lateral bars holding them together. Damage to these supports have been caused by flooding as well as a fish breeding program introduced into the lake which has caused the water to become stagnant. The Ministry of Culture’s Department of Archaeology, National Museum and Library plans to carry out repairs when plans for the work are finalised.

"Pennington Flash .Leigh. NW England.

Pennington Flash Country Park is a 200 hectares (494 acres) country park located between Lowton and Pennington, Leigh in Greater Manchester, England.

The flash is a 70 hectares (173 acres) lake created at the turn of the 20th century by coal mining subsidence, mainly from Bickershaw Colliery, and flooding.[1] Now an extensive nature reserve with several bird hides and a network of tracks and footpaths, Pennington Flash Country Park is nationally renowned for its birdlife and is a classic example of natural regeneration. A variety of well-maintained paths cater for walkers, cyclists and horse riders. Ideal for disabled persons, the Flash's hides have ramps for wheelchair access.

One of the premier birdwatching sites in North West England, over 230 bird species have been recorded on site including: Black-faced Bunting, Nightingale, Marsh Harrier, Spoonbill and Leach's Storm-petrel. Additionally, a wide variety of butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies can be spotted in the area.

Facilities include a small information centre, a nine-hole municipal golf course, a pay and display car park, a children’s play area, picnic and recreation areas, bird watching facilities, fishing on certain shores, sailing, windsurfing and rowing through Leigh and Lowton Sailing Club, a mobile café and toilets","['*reflexions*', 'bench', 'birds', 'leigh', 'pennington flash', 'pond']",PENNINGTON FLASH .WETLANDS.,Attribution-ShareAlike License,46781500@N00,jpg,-2.536768,6981764380,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/,1335781932,2012-03-28 11:29:41.0,53.485951,http://www.flickr.com/photos/46781500@N00/6981764380/,ronsaunders47,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D40

Gate's open up as the flood of people arrive to Magic Kingdom during the early Magic Hours for New Years Eve. It's something different as you walk (briskly) through Main Street USA with no one ahead of you. Although many people were behind me still meandering around the main entrance of Main Street you can't help but take in the view of Cinderella's Castle with no one around except for a few Cast Members setting things up here and there.

This image was taken right before I set up my spot at the other end of the Partners hub for the New Years celebration fireworks that would go off at midnight. It was quite the day of people watching, parade watching and seeing what kind of images I could get all from the same spot for an entire day.

Helloww I`m back,how are you mate? :)

Since my last upload i`ve been playing with analog photography.

At first i thought just for fun i shoot with film once in a while but i think i`ve been involved too much shooting with film was way too charmin and challengin i can`t help it.

a half of my refrigerator was booked by a bunch of roll film,..(my mom is frowning i hijacked her refrigeratot :D )

i bought quite few film camera (but my favorite for now is Canon EOS 5)

bought a film scanner

i even ended up bought a develop kit and managed to learn develop my own film (for now only BW though but i`m proud :P )

but all this time i haven`t confidence enough to upload it at flickr since film scanning was pretty annoying and this scanner i use Canoscan 9000F can`t exploited the quality of negative film,..soft,.weird color cast and it peaked at some highlight point,..now i`m bear with it,..but someday i will get myself some Nikon Coolscan i hope.

Enough chit chat for now i think there will be a lot of film stuff flooding my stream.

Cheers!","['135l', '9000f', 'analog', 'bokeh', 'boy', 'candid', 'canon', 'canonef135mmf2lusm', 'canoneos5', 'canoneosa2', 'canoscan', 'child', 'cinematic', 'cute', 'documentary', 'eos5', 'eye contact', 'film', 'film is not dead', 'fujifilm', 'funny', 'indonesia', 'lampung', 'paparazzi', 'portrait', 'rifat attamimi', 'street photography', 'superia', 'yet']",Some Bald Boy Cuter Than Other`s Bald Boy,Attribution-NoDerivs License,23389695@N03,jpg,105.254096,6980566950,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/,1335749893,2012-04-30 07:16:20.0,-5.40921,http://www.flickr.com/photos/23389695@N03/6980566950/,Rifat Attamimi,

"The Panathinaiko or Panathenaic Stadium (also known as the Kallimarmaron, i.e. the ""beautifully marbled"") in Athens is the only major stadium in the world built fully of white marble (from Mount Penteli). It should not be confused with the Panathinaikos football pitch (officially called the Apostolos Nikolaidis stadium) at Alexandras Avenue.
In ancient times it was used to host the athletic portion of the Panathenaic Games in honour of the Goddess Athena. During classical times the stadium had wooden seating. It was remade in marble by the archon Lycurgus in 329 BC and was enlarged and renovated by Herodes Atticus in 140 AD, to a seated capacity of 50,000. The remnants of the ancient structure were excavated and refurbished, with funds provided by Evangelos Zappas for the revival of the Olympic Games.[1] Evangelos Zappas sponsored Olympic Games that were held there in 1870 and 1875.[1] The stadium was refurbished a second time in 1895 for the 1896 Summer Olympics, with completion funding provided by the Greek benefactor George Averoff (whose marble statue now stands at the entrance), based on designs by architects Anastasios Metaxas and Ernst Ziller. The stadium was built long before dimensions for athletics venues were standardized and its track and layout follow the ancient hairpin-like model. It can seat about 80,000 spectators on 50 rows of marble steps.

It is located in downtown Athens, east of the National Gardens and the Zappeion Exhibition Hall, west of the Pankrati residential district and between the twin pine-covered hills of Ardettos and Agra. Up to the 1950s, the Ilissos River (now covered by, and flowing underneath, Vasileos Konstantinou Avenue) ran in front of the stadium's entrance, and the spring of Kallirrhoe, the sanctuary of Pankrates (a local hero) and the Cynosarges public gymnasium were nearby.
The Fokianos sports facility lies across Vasileos Konstantinou Avenue, and adjacent to it are located the Athens tennis club, the Ethnikos athletics track, the Federation swimming pool, the remnants of the Temple of Olympian Zeus, and Hadrian's Gate. Until the late 19th century and the containment of the Ilissos riverbed, the area was reedy and often flooded, and was called the ""Vatrahonisi"" (Frog Island).

In more recent years this stadium has been often used to honour the homecoming of victorious Greek athletes, most notably the Greek national football team after its victory at the 2004 European Football Championship and also the opening ceremony of the World Athletics Championships in 1997, on a concept by composer Vangelis Papathanasiou.
The Panathenaic Stadium commemorative coin

In the 2004 Olympic Games, the Panathinaiko Stadium hosted the archery competition, and the finish of the Marathon.

The steam engine was purchased from the Atlanta Flour Mill owned by Richard Peters and more than 2,750,000 pounds of first-quality gunpowder (a majority of the powder used by the Confederacy), was produced here before it's closure on April 18, 1865. It has been said the Confederacy never lost a battle for lack of powder.

Although the massive works were dismantled after the war ended, the commandant and officer responsible for their construction, Colonel Reins, asked that the smokestack remain as a monument to the efforts of the those who built and worked within the site. The Powderworks chimney still stands today on the Augusta Canal and is one of the more recognizable features of the Augusta skyline. The chimney and a historical marker about the Powderworks are located in Sibley Mill at 1717 Goodrich Street in Augusta.

"..or the years?


  Remains of a house (church?) in a small village (Bezidul Nou / Bözödújfalu) in  Transylvania, that was mostly flooded when a new dam was erected nearby.
  The village happened to be in the area that was to be flooded by the artificial lake of the dam.
  On one hand it was a destroyed community, on the other a lot more communities were saved from annual (natural) floods of the river through this dam's control.

[while this picture and the next are two different buildings, IIRC this was a church building as well, though one of some other rite]","['bezidul nou', 'buildings', 'country', 'green', 'openair', 'romania', 'traveling']",Remains of the Day,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,15639842@N00,jpg,24.904804,352182527,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1168386398,2006-09-09 10:10:30.0,46.421943,http://www.flickr.com/photos/15639842@N00/352182527/,zedworks,"OLYMPUS CORPORATION u20D,S400D,u400D"

"Title Translation: South of Lier

To the south of Lier there are is quite a bit of empty land, which is unusual around these parts. while it is empty, it's not useless, it's kept empty to act as a safety valve on the Nete - the dykes are lower here, and when the river rises, it's this empty land that floods, rather than the local towns of Lier or Duffel (at least in theory).

Visible in the distance (and on slightly higher ground), is 'Kasteel Ringenhof' (Ringenhof Castle - though the Belgians are very generous with their definition of a castle).","['belgium', 'landscape shot', 'lier', 'pathway', 'river', 'topaz adjust', 'walking']",Ten Zuiden van Lier,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,23966421@N06,jpg,4.554138,11753122834,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1388846463,2013-12-28 14:17:37.0,51.116488,http://www.flickr.com/photos/23966421@N06/11753122834/,bbusschots,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D5100

In far northeastern Namibia, there is a skinny stretch of land sandwiched between Angola, Botswana, and Zambia. The Caprivi Strip receives more than 600 millimeters (24 inches) of mean annual rainfall and experiences periodic floods, making it almost moist compared to the much drier parts of the country.

On February 1, 2012, the Advanced Land Imager (ALI) on NASA’s Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) satellite captured this natural-color image of the Caprivi Strip just north of the Okavango River (visible in the large image). Here the land is striped, as if a giant had dragged a rake over the landscape. Those stripes are linear dunes, and some are more than 100 kilometers (60 miles) long. Their presence suggests much drier conditions in the past.

Dunes generally form from wind-blown sand over many years. One characteristic of linear dunes is that they tend to remain intact long after the dry conditions cease. And because they don’t migrate like marching dunes, linear dunes preserve dirt and rocks that geologists can later use to understand past conditions.

A study published in 2000 sampled dunes throughout the Caprivi region and found that they likely formed under arid conditions between roughly 60,000 and 20,000 years ago. A study in 2003 concluded that dune construction may have been especially pronounced between 36,000 and 28,000 years ago. After the dunes formed, conditions in the Caprivi Strip moistened enough for the dunes to support vegetation—woodlands on the dune ridges, and grasses and shrubs in the valleys between.

Although studies indicate that conditions in this region were drier when the dunes formed, the dune-building periods seem to have been punctuated by humid periods, as indicated by sediments found in nearby caves and ancient lake sediments. About 16,000 years ago, a humid period prompted the filling of Etosha Pan. Now a saltpan, Etosha withered partly due to drying climate, but also because of changes in river routes.

"The Treaty of London between the Netherlands and Belgium in 1839 recognised the independence of Belgium. As part of the treaty, Belgium had the right to build a road or canal from Sittard to the Prussian border over Dutch territory, with Belgium funding the construction. This right was further established in the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. At first Belgium planned to dig a canal, but in the end it opted for a railway.
In 1868 construction of the Iron Rhine started, and in 1879 the first trains used the railway. Initially, traffic was dense and frequent, but it decreased over time. Currently the railroad is used by some trains between Antwerp and the zinc factory in Budel, and between Budel and Weert. The line Weert - Roermond is part of the Dutch Intercity network, and is used daily by many trains. Between Roermond and the German border, traffic has fully ceased since 1991.
In 2004 Belgium requested a reopening of the Iron Rhine. This is the result of the increasing transport of goods between the port of Antwerp and the German Ruhr Area. As part of the European policy of modal shift on the increasing traffic of goods, transport over railway lines and waterways is preferred over road transport.
Currently Belgium uses the Montzenroute, south of the Iron Rhine, from Antwerp to Aachen via Aarschot, Hasselt, Tongeren and Montzen, for transportation of goods to Germany. High passenger traffic on parts of this route causes a lack of capacity for goods, and a number of steep inclines over the route make it problematic for long and heavy trains.
The Belgian request is based on the treaty of 1839, and the Iron Rhine Treaty of 1873. Critics feel that Belgium cannot call upon these treaties, as in the treaty of 1873 Belgium had been granted a concession of 99 years on the Iron Rhine Railroad, a period which ended in 1972. Furthermore, Belgium has sold the railroad to the Dutch Government. The strongest argument is that the railroad runs through the nature reserve of De Meinweg, and nature activists fear destruction of the local habitat of several threatened species.
After a series of failed negotiations, the Belgian and Dutch governments agreed to take the issue to the Permanent Court of Arbitration and respect its ruling in the case. In its ruling of May 24, 2005, the court acknowledged both the Belgian rights under the cessation treaty of 1839 and the Dutch concerns for the nature reserve. The 1839 treaty still applies, the court found, giving Belgium the right to use and modernize the Iron Rhine. However, it has to finance the modernisation of the line, while the Netherlands have to fund the repairs and maintenance of the route. Both countries will split the costs of the construction of a tunnel beneath the nature reserve.

"The final and undoubtedly most important undergraduate chemical engineering course at Texas A&M University is CHEN 426: Chemical Engineering Plant Design.  It is rigorous and life-consuming.  Each team is required to submit a detailed report concerning the design of a plant to produce a specified product.  

As part of the report, each team must include a team photo.  This team (Sean, Ryan, Jared, and Kristen) wanted to recreate The Beatles' Abbey Road album cover.  I jumped at the opportunity to try to take the photo, as I rarely take people pictures because none of my friends ever care to be photographed.  We had fun trying to take the photo while trying not to get hit by buses, campus maintenance vehicles, bicyclists, etc.

"The first mission house built at Waiilatpu was on this site. Marcus Whitman, William Grey and a number of laborers (mostly a Hawai'ian and an African-American freeman) built the tiny house in the late fall of 1836. The house flooded by the rising Walla Walla River with the spring thaw. It was crammed full of missionaries in the few years it served as the mission house... a situation that didn't bode well for already tense missionary relations. The house was dismantled when the main Mission House was built on slightly higher ground not too far away and the adobe bricks used in other constructions.

"Shattered glass litters the streets as officers and deputies survey and assess the damage done after an 18yr old Gainesville resident rammed into a squad car following a high speed chase across the city that began with a DUI. The car seen here at the right was actually stolen and the vehicle our criminal used to flee from the authorities. No one was seriously injured.I managed to gather all this info and several snapshots minutes after this all happened. It happened kind of on accident actually, I was getting some very early breakfast (between 2-3am) at Mcdonald's on my way home from work and as I was waiting in the drive-thru, i noticed literally about 20 law enforcement vehicles with their flashers on the other side of the 4 lane road. I was curious, so I grabbed my hash 
browns and went over to check it out. It turns out I was the first journalist on scene...pretty cool

"The desert fan palm, Washingtonia filifera, is native to the low hot deserts of southern California where it can live for 80 to 90 years. Towering up to 75 feet, the desert fan palm is among the tallest of North American palms. It is definitely the heaviest; a mature desert fan palm can weigh as much as three tons. Its distinctive leaves are shaped like a fan and folded like an accordion. They measure up to six feet in length and are nearly as wide. Looking much like “petticoats,” the fan palm’s dead leaves remain attached to its trunk until removed by fire, wind, or flood.

"On a sunny Saturday evening, about 6:30 or so. Beautiful light, beautiful place. Riding on the train, along the path the railroad calculated to be as low and flat and easy as it could be, while still above the 100 year flood... 

Simply put, the railroads were offered whatever they wanted, at attractive rates, sometimes free. Anyone who builds between the tracks and any body of water is just not thinking it through. Yes, I drove though the standing water at 880 and Dixon Landing in 1983. The rails are over 1/4 mile closer to Mission Peak and Warm Springs Blvd. 

I remember the storm drains at North 1st and Montague Expressway running backward. Montague elevates to pass over the rail lines, about half a mile back toward Santa Clara. High tides, hard rain and bad maintenance, and I hope we never see its like again. But always keep aware of your position relative to the local open water and railway lines. I know people who live in the flat part of Palo Alto, between the tracks along Alma and 101. French drains and immersable sump pumps. Collect the water uphill of the house and pump it out downhill, into the street. Its like living in a grounded boat. No fooling around either, the house has a concrete slab for a floor, no crawl space. 2"" (50mm) of freeboard!

"The famed San Antonio Riverwalk, or Paseo Del Rio, is a 2 1/2 mile stretch of beautifully landscaped waterfront that features many of San Antonio's most spectacular hotels, restaurants, night clubs, bars, shopping centers and businesses. It is one of the most dynamic tourist attractions in the entire state of Texas, pouring nearly $800 million a year into the local economy. While it is an amazing and romantic place to visit, that wasn't always true.

In the beginning, Spanish Explorers used the waterway to supply water to their missions. Mission San Antonio de Valero, also known as The Alamo, was the first to benefit from it. The river flooded its banks many times. In September 1921 the worst flood in its history killed over fifty people and caused millions of dollars in damage to the city.  City planners struggled over what to do while large debates rang among the people.  One man, an architect named Robert H. H. Hugman proposed a plan that would turn the area into a beautiful urban park with apartments, dining, shopping, boat rides and walk ways lit with old-fashioned street lamps. He wanted it to be just as if one were walking in Venice, Italy. After convincing city officials and business leaders of the financial benefits of his plan, the dream became a reality and the riverwalk was eventually sculpted into the masterpiece you see today",['texas'],Casa Rio on the Riverwalk,Attribution-NonCommercial License,81924773@N00,jpg,,3388386708,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1238098494,2009-03-26 23:58:00.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/81924773@N00/3388386708/,Princess Stand in the Rain,Canon EOS 20D

"We visited the temples of Abu Simbel late in the afternoon after the daytrippers had left (either fly from Aswan or else take the bus convoy that leaves at 4 a.m. for the 3½ hour drive).  It was amazing to think that the temples had been moved from their original locations to rescue them from flooding by Lake Nasser when Aswan High Dam was built in the 1960's.

The Sun Temple of Ramses II (19th Dynasty, 1279-1213 BCE) was hewn from a mountainside.  The four statues of Ramses dwarf the sun god in the center.  The damaged second statue was another casualty of the earthquake in 27 BCE.  The temple was situated such that the sun's rays penetrated deep inside to illuminate the back sanctuary on Ramses' birthday and the anniversary of his coronation.  (The relocated temple was slightly misoriented so the illumination occurs a day off now.)

[In the late 1840's David Roberts published lithographs of the Abu Simbel temples at their original site. <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002718695/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002718695/</a> <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717575/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717575/</a> <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002718662/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002718662/</a> <a href=""http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717569/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.loc.gov/pictures/item/2002717569/</a> ]

"A river or stream is a challenging habitat. Whatever enters or lives near the stream must adapt to its changing course, in addition to offering changes of its own. All living things in the area around you are affected, directly and indirectly, by this water source, Colbert Creek.

Look around, do you see signs of high water?  The cut away bank in front of you and the absence of larger hardwood trees across the stream are clues.  Heavy rainfall, which causes frequent flooding, makes it very difficult for seedling trees to get started.  The dense vegetation surrounding the stream, cattails, willows, and other low growing plants, thrive in the abundant water, while larger trees grow out of the flood zone.

"There were numerous Coastal Flood Advisories in DC this past month. A Coastal Flood Advisory is when  an abnormally high tide causes temporary inundations in low-lying areas. The flooding lasts a few hours around high tide before subsiding until the next high tide. 
At Kenilworth Aquatic Gardens the Anacostia River would flow into the cultivated ponds and create one large lagoon. After the tide goes out the ponds are left to drain to normal levels. While the water goes away many other things left by the tide get stuck there. Over the course of a few visits I would see humongous carp thrashing and splashing in the shallower parts . These are probably 15 pound fish that don't want to be stuck in a pond full of water lilies and iris. While making efforts to get back to the river I kept seeing them slither across the partially flooded pathways from pond to pond. Sometimes the water would be an inch or two deep at most.

"The Ochopee post office is considered to be the smallest post office in the United States. The building was formerly an irrigation pipe shed that belonged to the J.T. Guant Company tomato farm. However, in 1953 it was rather quickly turned into the Ochopee's general store and post office by postmaster Sidney Brown after the original Ochopee post office burned down in the middle of the night.

 The present building has been in use ever since as both a post office and ticket station for Trailways bus line.

Much of Salt Creek is usually dry at the surface and covered by a bright layer of salt which was created by many flooding and subsequent evaporation of water that periodically flows at the surface. Over time the small amount of solutes in the water accumulate to form this linear salt pan. The last survivor of the streams is Pupfish.

"<b>Flood gauge affixed to the wall on the lower embankment along the River Seine, Île de la Cité, Paris (France).</b>

This cannot be a tide gauge because the Seine is not tidal in Paris, but it is very susceptible to serious floods. The units of the gauge seem a bit puzzling as there is nothing on the gauge to say what they are, but if this post-dates the French Revolution, then the gauge is presumably metric, in which case the spacing of these numbered units (as I remember) is about right for decimetres. (There was also series of larger digits and more widely spaced divisions that looked about 1 m apart, not visible in this shot.) The gradations are a bigger mystery. The arrowed divisions obviously point to whole numbers (of decimetres): 2 - (3) - 4 - (5) - etc, in which case the successive upper and lower edges of each raised division are 0.2 decimetres (= 2 cm) apart. This would mean that for the '2' mark, the upward sequence would be: 2.1 - 2.3 - 2.5 - 2.7 - 2.9 (decimetres).

There seems to be hand-scrawled 'x' next to the '2'.  Was this some historical flood level, or perhaps a critical level for sounding alerts?  

Photo taken on Île de la Cité embankment (lower pedestrian level on the R bank) somewhere between Notre-Dame cathedral and the western end of the island.  I didn't note where exactly, and haven't been able to find it in it Google Street, so geotag is approximate.

<b><i>LONDON - PARIS - CATANIA - ROME - LONDON -----  DAY 2</i></b>

<i>Photo from the <u>second day</u> of our crazy long distance rail trip from home (London) to Sicily. We spent the <u>first day</u> travelling from home in London to Paris, by Eurostar train, and were meant to the take an overnight train from Paris to Rome that same evening.  But our Eurostar train out of London was badly delayed due to 'a fatality [unexplained - perhaps fortunately] on the train'.  So we missed our onward connection to Rome and had an unexpected but happy <u>second day</u> in Paris. We left Paris that evening, on the equivalent Rome service.

By the end of the whole holiday trip we had seen things and sites from ancient Greek time to modern, so the trip felt like a mini Grand Tour. Or given the rich mythology of Sicily, Etna and the Straits of Messina (Odysseus, the Cyclops, Scylla & Charybdis, etc.) perhaps our trip was like a modern mini Odyssey of our times. Odysseus took ten years to get home. It took us ten trains - but no monsters. </i>

"Here's what wikipedia has to say on the subject:

Little now remains of the original arena floor, but the hypogeum is still clearly visible. It consisted of a two-level subterranean network of tunnels and cages beneath the arena where gladiators and animals were held before contests began. Eighty vertical shafts provided instant access to the arena for caged animals and scenery pieces concealed underneath; larger hinged platforms, called hegmata, provided access for elephants and the like. It was restructured on numerous occasions; at least twelve different phases of construction can be seen.

The hypogeum was connected by underground tunnels to a number of points outside the Colosseum. Animals and performers were brought through the tunnel from nearby stables, with the gladiators' barracks at the Ludus Magnus to the east also being connected by tunnels. Separate tunnels were provided for the Emperor and the Vestal Virgins to permit them to enter and exit the Colosseum without needing to pass through the crowds.

Substantial quantities of machinery also existed in the hypogeum. Elevators and pulleys raised and lowered scenery and props, as well as lifting caged animals to the surface for release. There is evidence for the existence of major hydraulic mechanisms and according to ancient accounts, it was possible to flood the arena rapidly, presumably via a connection to a nearby aqueduct.","['colosseum', 'hypogeum', 'italy', 'rome']",Hypogeum,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,43002463@N00,jpg,12.492259,2747641226,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1218309192,2008-07-10 11:32:51.0,41.890317,http://www.flickr.com/photos/43002463@N00/2747641226/,Mushkush,Panasonic DMC-FX33

"It is somewhat hard to believe that when walking around Old Town Sacramento, you are often walking on top of what used to be the city. There are hints here and there, and a few places where you can see the original street level, but for the most part, it seems like Old Town has always been this elevation. 
Why did they bother to raise the city level you might ask yourself? Flooding of course. Apparently the flooding was so bad that the 8th Governor of California, Leland Stanford had to travel to his inauguration by rowboat.
So if you find yourself wandering around Old Town, and looking back at it from the docks, know that the water level that seems so low now, once was higher than those very tall supports you see here.","['2013', '60d', 'caffeinated captures', 'california', 'old town', 'river', 'sacramento', 'sacramento river', 'united states', 'west coast']",Standing Tall,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,69218326@N06,jpg,-121.506898,10220950205,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1381562446,2013-09-19 18:48:36.0,38.582088,http://www.flickr.com/photos/69218326@N06/10220950205/,Mr.Morgan.Murphy,Canon EOS 60D

river was running high--so high, in fact, that it had flooded half of
the parking lot down by the docks. This ramp doesn't go into the
water; it goes to the parking lot. The only reason one end of it is
still out of the water is because that concrete dock is buoyant.

"This remarkable view of Temple Newsam was almost certainly painted in 1750 for Henry, seventh Viscount Irwin. It shows the house from the East with many recently built features as well as many which were soon to be swept away. It is very instructive to contrast it with some of the other engravings and views to be seen nearby.

The large pond in the foreground had probably been constructed by Henry's elder brothers Arthur and Rich, successively fourth and fifth Viscounts Irwin, during the second decade of the century when the park had been relandscaped in a 
formal Baroque style. In contrast, the two large buildings in the middle distance - a stable block and (perhaps) a riding school - had only recently been constructed by Henry. Likewise the two smaller pavilions, terrace wall and steps into the 
courtyard. Most of these features were to be swept away (except for the stables block) after 1758 when Capability Brown was brought in to modernise the park and its relationship to the house in a naturalistic style.

This is the only view of the house and park showing the large building in the 
middle distance to the left - possibly a riding school, and since no trace of it had survived it was generally thought to represent 'artist's licence' and an attempt to symmetricalise the composition. Alternatively it was thought that it might show an intended building which was never in fact completed. However, during the drought of 1995 'crop marks' revealed that the building had indeed been 
constructed and a clear outline of its plan was visible by the naked eye.       

The identity of the artist responsible for this picture had long been a mystery until the signature of James Chapman emerged during a recent cleaning","['1700', 'arcitecture', 'ceramics', 'countryside', 'decoratice art', 'england', 'fine art', 'furniture', 'gallery', 'gardens', 'historic', 'historical', 'history', 'house', 'landscape', 'leeds', 'mansion', 'museum', 'newsam', 'painting', 'paintings', 'park', 'temple', 'temple newsam', 'uk', 'venue', 'weddings', 'wood', 'yorkshire']",A Prospect of Temple Newsam,Attribution-NonCommercial License,27252300@N05,jpg,-1.461353,5332752875,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1294413946,2005-11-26 13:07:02.0,53.785744,http://www.flickr.com/photos/27252300@N05/5332752875/,Leeds Museums and Galleries,

"This photograph shows a car driving onto the Kingston punt, (ferry), which crossed the River Murray, linking the Sturt Highway, which ran from over the border to Adelaide.  
When I was a child there was a charge to use the ferry, one shilling a car, and a penny a person.  Prior to that it was also used to ferry sheep, cattle and horses across the river, and they were charged accordingly.  
When a bridge was built at Kingston there were two ferries operating, and they were closed down the day the bridge was officially opened by the South Australian Governor, Sir Mark Oliphant.  The road to the ferry ran straight through the township of Cobdogla, before the by-pass was built. 
By then the Sturt Highway had become a major road, catering not only for the locals, going backwards and forwards across the river, particularly the grape trucks taking loads down to the wineries in the Barossa Valley, but for interstate traffic as well.  
Prior to the bridge being built, every time there was a high river, or flood, the ferry was closed and traffic was diverted when the road went under.  After the 1956 flood, when the river rose 21 feet above pool level, discussions began to build a bridge across the river.  The causeway to the bridge was built above the '56 flood level. 
During peak times, like holidays, or line-ups of grape trucks, people could wait for hours to get across the river.  That was why a second punt was built at Kingston.  The building of the bridge put an end to the delays.

"Mosaic Canyon is a canyon in the north western mountain face of the valley which is named after a stream-derived breccia sediment with angular blocks of dolomite in a pebbly matrix. The entrance to Mosaic Canyon appears deceptively ordinary, but just a 1/4 mile (400m) walk up the canyon narrows dramatically to a deep slot cut into the face of Tucki Mountain. Smooth, polished marble walls enclose the trail as it follows the canyon's sinuous curves. The canyon follows faults that formed when the rocky crust of the Death Valley region began stretching just a few million years ago. Running water scoured away at the fault-weakened rock, gradually carving Mosaic canyon.
Periodic flash floods carry rocky debris (sediment) eroded from Mosaic Canyon and the surrounding hillsides toward the valley below. At the canyon mouth water spreads out and deposits its sediment load, gradually building up a large wedge-shaped alluvial fan that extends down toward Stovepipe Wells. This canyon was formed through a process of cut and fill which included periodic erosive floods followed by long periods of deposition and uplift. But due to the uplift when the next flood hit the area it would deeply cut the streambed which forms stair step-shaped banks.


Dolomite promontory at Mosaic Canyon, with view of Death Valley
Mosaic Canyon's polished marble walls are carved from the Noonday Dolomite and other Precambrian carbonate rocks. These rock formation began as limestone deposited during Late Precambrian (about 850-700 million years ago) when the area was covered by a warm sea. Later addition of magnesium changed the limestone, a rock made of calcium carbonate, to dolomite, a calcium-magnesium carbonate. The dolomite was later deeply buried by younger sediment. Far below the surface, high pressure and temperature altered the dolomite into the metamorphic rock, marble. The Noonday Dolomite has since been tilted from uplift.
Mosaic Canyon was named for a rock formation known as the Mosaic Breccia. Breccia is an Italian word meaning gravel. This formation is composed of angular fragments of many different kinds of parent rock, and it can be seen on the floor of the canyon just south of the parking area.

"Tal Chhapar Sanctuary is a sanctuary located in the Churu district of Northwestern Rajasthan in the Bikaner division of India. It is 210 km from Jaipur and situated on road from Ratangarh to Sujangarh. The Tal Chhapar sanctuary lies in the Sujangarh Tehsil of Churu District. It lies on Nokha- Sujangarh state Highway and is situated at a distance of 85 km from Churu & about 132 km from Bikaner. The nearest Railway station is Chappar which lies on Degana – Churu – Rewari metre gauge line of North Western Railways. The nearest Airport is Sanganer (Jaipur) which is at a distance of 215 km from Chappar. It is known for black bucks and is also home to a variety of birds.

The Tal Chhapar sanctuary is located on the fringe of the Great Indian Desert. Tal Chhapar nestles a unique refuge of the most elegant Antelope encountered in India, ""the Black buck"". Tal Chhaper sanctuary, with almost flat tract and interspersed shallow low lying areas, has open grassland with scattered Acacia and prosopis trees which give it an appearance of a typical Savanna. The word ""Tal"" means plane land. The rain water flows through shallow low lying areas and collect in the small seasonal water ponds.

The Geology of the zone is obscured by the wind blown over-burden. Some small hillocks and exposed rocks of slate and quartzite are found in the western side of the sanctuary. Area between hillocks and the sanctuary constitutes the watershed area of the sanctuary. The whole sanctuary used to be flooded by water during the heavy rains but with salt mining going on in the watershed. Hardly any rain water falling on the hillocks reach the Sanctuary","['antilope', 'bikaner', 'blackbuck', 'churu', 'deer', 'india', 'rajasthan', 'tal chhapar']",blackbuck in a jump...,Attribution License,65550314@N06,jpg,74.423446,7301483312,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1338382538,2012-05-27 08:02:20.0,27.836647,http://www.flickr.com/photos/65550314@N06/7301483312/,Archit Ratan Photography,Panasonic DMC-FZ35

"is a subdivision of the municipality of Beveren in the Flemish province of Oost-Vlaanderen. It is located near the river the Scheldt, in a polder of the Waasland.
 
The first mention of the village dates from 1267, when ""The Doolen"" name is first mentioned. Until the 18th century the village was an island surrounded by purposfully flooded land, with the remainder, north of the village, known as ""The Drowned Land of Saeftinghe"". The ""Eylandt den Doel"" is completely surrounded by old seawalls. The dike encloses the hamlets of ""Sweet Verge"", ""Saftingen"", ""Rapenburg"" and ""Ouden Doel"" (Olden Doel).
 
The polder Doel site is unique to Belgium and dates from the Eighty Years War (1568-1648). The typical checkerboard pattern dates from 1614, when these geometric farmlands were first mapped, and they have not changed very much over the years. This fact makes the village a rare example of regional urbanization.[1] The village has many historic buildings, including the oldest stone windmill of the country (1611), and the only windmill on a sea wall. The Baroque Hooghuis (1613) that is associated with the entourage and holdings of the famous 17th century Antwerp painter, Peter Paul Rubens.[2]
 
Some of the other historical and cultural buildings in the town area are the ""Reynard Farm"" (De Reinaerthoeve), with a monumental farmhouse and barn. ""De Doolen"" is a historic school. ""De Putten"", or ""The Wells"", is a peat extraction area and has an historically unique 18th century farmstead and inn site ""The Old Hoefyzer"", with one of the last remaining historic barns.
 
To the north of Doel one can find the Electrabel-owned Nuclear Plant Doel with 4 reactors with a total output of 2,8 GW delivering electricity to customers in Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.
 
Doel is threatened with complete demolition due to the future enlargement of the harbour of Antwerp. This has seen many people having to sell their homes to the development corporation of that enlargement. Many historical buildings will be destroyed.
 
According to a news conference and press release from August 20, 2008, ""The Flemish Executive started last week with the demolition of the village of Doel on a massive scale. The historic village is situated in the vicinity of the Port of Antwerp. However there are still 200 inhabitants in the village who resist the demolition of their homes. That is the reason why the Flemish Executive resorted to sending a 100 strong squad of riot police to the village in order to force through the start of the demolition works. The sheer brutality and heavy handed approach of the Flemish Executive has left the remaining villagers humiliated and the wider region in a state of shock. The streets are strewn with rubble, big ugly gaps appeared in between the houses. The village now looks like a war torn zone. But still, the villagers show resilience and announced to go on with their resistance in a bid to save their village.""[3]
 
An author says in one magazine article concerning the demolition of the village, ""The Belgian village of Doel was reclaimed from the river Scheldt at the beginning of the 17th century. Three-hundred years later and the village that would grow behind the sea wall is under threat. The threat comes not from a failing dyke or an unexpectedly sudden rise in water levels, but rather from the expanding Port of Antwerp and its insatiable need for more and more land along the Scheldt in which to grow. Now, Doel, the last of the Belgian polder villages on the banks of the Scheldt near the North Sea, faces possible demolition. The construction of a large dock and container terminal capable of receiving deep-sea ships is already underway on a site immediately next to the village, and the Port Authority proposes building a second one where the village now stands.""[4]

"National Register of Historic Places: 92001522, Added January 6, 1993
__________

The Mount Lowe Railway was the third in a series of scenic mountain railroads in America created as a tourist attraction on Echo Mountain and Mount Lowe, north of Los Angeles, California. The railway, originally incorporated by Professor Thaddeus S. C. Lowe as the Pasadena & Mt. Wilson Railroad Co.[1] existed from 1893 until its official abandonment in 1938, and had the distinction of being the only scenic mountain, electric traction (overhead electric trolley) railroad ever built in the United States. Lowe’s partner and engineer was David J. Macpherson, a civil engineer graduate of Cornell University. The Mount Lowe Railway was a fulfillment of 19th century Pasadenans to have a scenic mountain railroad to the crest of the San Gabriel Mountains.

The Railway opened on 4 July 1893, and consisted of nearly seven miles (11.2 km) of track starting in Altadena, California at a station called Mountain Junction. The railway climbed the steep Lake Avenue and crossed the Poppyfields into the Rubio Canyon. This part of the trip was called the Mountain Division.[2] At this juncture stood the Rubio Pavilion, a small 12-room hotel. From there the passengers transferred to a cable car funicular which climbed the Great Incline to the top of the Echo Mountain promontory.[3]

Atop Echo stood the magnificent 70-room Victorian hotel, the Echo Mountain House. Only a few hundred feet away stood the 40-room Echo Chalet which was ready for opening day. The complement of buildings on Echo included an astronomical observatory, car barns, dormitories and repair facilities, a casino and dance hall, and a menagerie of local fauna.[4]Passengers could then transfer to another trolley line, the Alpine Division, which would take them to the upper terminus at Crystal Springs and Ye Alpine Tavern, a 22-room Swiss Chalet hospice with a complement of amenities from tennis courts, to wading pools, to mule rides.[5]

For the seven years during which Lowe owned and operated the railway, it constantly ran into hard times. For one, its location was off the beaten path of the common traveler with little means of transportation up to the Altadena hillside.[6] For another, fares did not cover the cost of continuous construction done on money borrowed at 10 1/2% interest, and the opening day fare of $5.00 would not remain attractive to the greater public.[7] Lowe went into receivership one or two times before losing the railway to Jared S. Torrance in 1899.[8] The tiny railway was purchased at auction by a Mr. Valentine Payton of Danville, Illinois[9] who, after only 14 months, sold it to Henry Huntington of the Pacific Electric Railway in 1902.[10] Huntington operated it as a fringe venture the rest of its days alongside his expansive Red Car system that covered the greater Los Angeles and Orange County areas.

A series of natural disasters ate away at the facilities, the first of which was a kitchen fire that destroyed the Echo Mountain House in 1900.[11] A 1905 fire destroyed the rest of the Echo buildings except for the observatory and the astronomer's cabin.[12] In 1909 a flash flood tore out the Rubio Pavilion.[13] In 1928 a gale force wind toppled the observatory.[14] And in 1936 an electrical fire wiped out the Tavern.[15]

The Mount Lowe Railway was officially abandoned in 1938 after a horrendous rain washed most everything off the mountain sides.[16] Today, the ruins of Mount Lowe Railway remain as a monument to a once-ever experienced enterprise. It was placed on the National Register of Historical Places on January 6, 1993.

The building itself, built in the Beaux-Arts style, is made from Manitoba Tyndall limestone. The stone has traces of fossils in it from the time Manitoba was an inland sea called Lake Agassiz. 

One of Manitoba's best known symbols is the Golden Boy statue that sits on top of the Legislative dome. Created by French sculptor Georges Gardet, the Golden Boy is covered with 23 ½ carat gold.","['architecture', 'art', 'canada', 'city', 'culture', 'experience', 'fossils', 'free masons', 'georges gardet', 'gold', 'golden boy', 'heritage', 'hermetic code', 'history', 'lake agassiz', 'limestone', 'manitoba', 'manitoba legislative building', 'masonic', 'mysterious', 'summer', 'symbols', 'the leg', 'tour', 'travel', 'travel manitoba', 'winnipeg']","In bloom at ""The Leg""",Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,56045791@N08,jpg,-97.130126,5190112186,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1290186416,2006-04-28 14:53:33.0,49.887998,http://www.flickr.com/photos/56045791@N08/5190112186/,Travel Manitoba,

"Non-motorized boating pilot program comes to an end

LOS ANGELES — When the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Los Angeles District, granted a license in July for a seven week non-motorized boating pilot program on the Los Angeles River, the Los Angeles Conservation Corps quickly booked the allotted tours.

“It took about 10 minutes for the 280 tickets to sell, once we posted the announcement on line,” said Yasmin Mero-Corona, program coordinator, Los Angeles Conservation Corps. “We had another 300 on a waiting list to fill any no-shows. One gentleman stood by with his check every weekend until we had a cancellation for him to fill,” Mero-Corona added. 

The test program allowed for no more than two trips per day on Friday, Saturday and Sunday beginning August 12 and ending September 25. The program was as much about education as it was access, with many of the tours featuring guest speakers, including Corps personnel, talking about the history of the river and plans for its revitalization. 

The Mountains Recreation and Conservation Authority supervised the two-hour canoe and kayak trips covering a 1.5-mile stretch of the river. While most of the trip is a leisurely ride the 'Cattail Shoot' provides a bit of excitement as the staff helps participants and their vessels through a narrow, shallow shoot and one portage point, 'Rocky Rapids,' that requires boaters to exit their crafts and navigate the rocks on foot.   

“A mentor of mine when I was a biologist at New York District was fond of saying, touch the resource. That's what accessing the river is to so many urban dwellers in Los Angeles,” said Josephine Axt, Chief, Planning Division, Los Angeles District, during her tour September 16. 

“Even though there are nearby mountains where people can enjoy the outdoors, their day to day experience doesn't usually encourage or encompass much of a non-urban environment. Accessing the river is symbolic of a shared vision many LA residents have of the city embracing a more sustainable future,” added Axt.

For many boaters these trips represented their first access to the river and their enthusiasm was not tied to their skill level.

“The participants were nervous at first because for many adults, this was the first time on a canoe or kayak,” said Supervising Ranger III, Fernando Gomez.  “However, at the end of the trip, they wanted more and some even said they were going to go out and buy a kayak to continue their experience, not on the LA River of course.  For the skilled kayakers, they walked away with the surprise of how beautiful and calming the trip was,” Gomez added.

The Corps is an active partner in revitalizing and preserving the Los Angeles River, however, an important primary mission remains. 

“I must be clear, nothing we do can jeopardize human safety or reduce the flood carrying capacity of this river,” said Col. Mark Toy, Los Angeles District Commander, during his opening remarks for the inaugural tour Aug. 8. 

Now that the non-motorized boating pilot program has ended, no boating is authorized on the Los Angeles River.  The river can, very quickly, become extremely dangerous, especially during the general winter storm season.

The Corps will review trip reports and lessons learned from staff and participants. Working with the stakeholders the Corps will carefully consider all options for boating on the Los Angeles River in future years.","['army', 'boating', 'la district', 'la river', 'military', 'outdoor', 'paddle the los angeles river', 'recreation', 'urban', 'usace', 'usace photo by dave palmer']",Paddle the Los Angeles River,Attribution-NoDerivs License,51640646@N04,jpg,-118.501195,6154373377,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/2.0/,1316235343,2011-09-16 11:19:40.0,34.186884,http://www.flickr.com/photos/51640646@N04/6154373377/,U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Los Angeles District,OLYMPUS IMAGING CORP.

"Charleston, SC. Memminger Elementary School, 20 Beaufain Street. Memminger School, interior courtyard, Charleston, SC. Photo taken October 2006. Side elevation of Memminger Auditorium, once this school's own separate free-standing theater, is seen in the background.

Memminger School in its present form was constructed before 1955. It occupies the site that was Memminger High School for Girls from c.1855 until 1950, which essentially was the entire span of time that the City of Charleston was directly involved with establishing, maintaining and expanding the city's public school system. Prior to 1855, public education was encouraged by the city, but actually supervised by charitable groups or autonomous commissions established by the local government. In the 1850's the mayor and city council took the extra step by directly establishing and funding a city board of public schools. 

Memminger High School was started as what was called a normal school or teacher training school with the plan that it would prepare young women to become teachers who would staff the city's four new elementary or schools. The city also was operating in direct contrast with regional customs, common perception and state law when it operated one of the four new schools to benefit children of the city's skilled artisans and craftsmen who were typically free persons of color in a society where the unskilled labor force was dependent on slave labor. Charleston in the 1850's was a city of contradictions, attempting to compete with modern industrial markets while also struggling to maintain the status quo for its agricultural economy dependent on cheap labor which was becoming more expensive with each year that followed. 

Ultimately, the agricultural economy, slave labor and the old political order were all swept away with the Civil War that engulfed the city ten years after the city's public school system was founded. Though the local economy was in ruins, the educational institutions founded in the former times of wealth were still intact. What began with a trickle of public interest and support for the city schools before the war became a flood of enrollment from all social and economic groups after the war.

In 1948, the city council divested itself of direct control of the city's public schools. A separate school board was set apart to oversee, plan and raise public funds to support the city schools which by this time managed 4 high schools, including 2 complete vocational programs, 2 junior high schools and 9 elementary schools.  The newly empowered city school board set about building 5 new schools. During the 1950's the total enrollment in all city schools was about 8,000 students. Fifteen schools including 5 high schools and 10 elementary schools serve an area not more than 3 miles by 2 miles located on a peninsula that was bounded by two tidal rivers, a major harbor and separated from the main land by an industrial dead zone that effectively made the city an island. In 1955 Memminger Elementary School was one of the city's newest schools, located in it oldest neighborhood. The city's elite and working classes both sent their children to Memminger. It was also one of the city's first schools to be racially integrated in 1963.

In 2008, very few children from the immediate neighborhood attend this school. The empty bicycle racks seen along the right side of the photo reflect the current demographics. The city schools are no longer overseen by the local citizens but are managed through a large consolidated regional school system. Schools like Memminger have ceased to be places that are strongly supported by nearby neighborhoods that once were identified by the reputation of the local schools.

The fifty year old building is still very functional. The racially diverse and economically strong neighborhood still has many children. The success of this location in support of a variety of educational and cultural activities has been continuous since the 1690's. 

So why is this school no longer a reflection of the surrounding neighborhoods? It takes people who know a place to run its schools successfully and in sync with the location. In this case, those running the public schools are not of this place. At best they are deaf missionaries. In the mean time, once great schools operate at less than half their potential.","['1954', '2006', '2006 october', '2008', '2008 november', 'beaufain street', 'ccsd', 'charleston', 'charleston county school district', 'christopher g. memminger', 'civil rights', 'gone', 'hdescopeland', 'memminger school', 'public schools', 'schools', 'seismic']","Charleston, Beaufain Street, Memminger Elementary School",Attribution-NonCommercial License,21957530@N07,jpg,-79.935783,2233227160,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/,1201800287,2006-10-26 07:46:41.0,32.780852,http://www.flickr.com/photos/21957530@N07/2233227160/,hdes.copeland,OLYMPUS CORPORATION C740UZ

The small stream connecting Upper and Lower Island Lake, part of the Root River system. The stream in the picture is very short, it starts at the other end of the culverts and ends at my feet. Where I was standing was in the middle of the stream just as it entered Lower Island Lake. Above the culverts is Upper Island Lake. I beleive that these are natural lakes, but I wonder how they were formed, since there is little distance between them but quite a difference in elevation.

<u>My new tripod broke today</u>, I just got my new Manfrotto 190CX3 carbon fiber tripod just over a month ago and today when I took it out to shoot this area the leg fell off when I opened one of the lower clamps, I have no idea why, but I am still able to use it, I just need to make sure it does not fall out when adjusting the legs. Do you think Manfrotto will replace it for me?

The fishing regulations are tighter this year where I live. You are now not able to have a combination of more than 5 salmonidae species in your possession. Only 2 rainbow trout, 5 brook trout, and 2 lake trout maximum. You are only allowed to keep one lake trout over 14 inches in length, with certain streams entering Lake Superior you cannot keep any brook trout under 22 inches in length, some of these streams that have this limit I doubt will ever have brook trout that large in them. I caught my first brook trout of the year today.

<b>About the Photo<b></b></b>
*Camera: Canon EOS Digital Rebel XS  *Lens: EF-S 18-55mm  ƒ/3.5-5.6 IS *Shutter Speed: N/A   *Aperture Value: ƒ/11   *ISO: 100   *Focal Length: 18mm (28.8mm Equivalent in 35mm film)

I shot this on a tripod using mirror lockup, a polarizing filter, and a 2Sec. selftimer. This image in composed of 7 different exposures, one average exposure, three 1 stop underexposers, and three 1 stop overexposures. I opened the RAW files in Photomatix Pro and tone mapped them to my liking. I then used ACR to polish up the 16 bit TIFF and opened it in CS4 where I cloned out some distracting elements of the photo because there were a few houses in the background. I also did a little dodging and burning to help create contrast between the rocks and the water.

"One morning, like any morning, like no morning ever, (God sent (maybe)) the heavens opened up, before the sun was known, and rain came like rain has never visited this land---this ground—this town—this Earth.  
Rain. Becoming a creek and the creek becoming the rain--the force so thick, opaque and deafening.  The creek rushed ahead, gaining rolling devouring all-- engulfing uncontrollable.  The creek becoming everything every rock every tree, house ""Home"" and everything in its path becomes the creek until all here was the creek and the rain and only one could be discerned. Inseparable.  Breathe labored---the air could barley squeeze between the marble sized drops becoming a creek--a river—the flood.  No more than a creek becoming a wild creature---not evil but certainly not sanctimonious.  Not deliberate but not controlled, not vengeful but showing little mercy.   Its amoeboid arms reaching, covering, sweeping---moving houses as the inhabitants fled to watch their homes up rooted---moving away and slowly inevitably sinking and dissolving into the rain, the roaring creek; their entire ‘world’ moving away from them by a wild voracious herd of creatures: more powerful than man could devise and less selective. Intimidating all that only saw or merely heard of it and terrifying those that fled.   Its ghost like paws, its teeth and flaming eyes destined to devour all and almost accepting as such.",['franklin'],Stream,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,56783949@N00,jpg,,11347991,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1114706998,2005-04-28 08:49:58.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/56783949@N00/11347991/,biogreen,

"Archeological site of the indian-jesuit reduction of St. Miguel Arcanjo, declared World Heritage Site by Unesco in 1983.

The site is located in the small town of São Miguel das Missões, in southern Brasil. This village was founded in the end of the 17th century, but the main building of the church was build between 1735-1745. The church - in the barroque style - was build in sandstone by the indians and jesuits, following the project of Gean Battista Primoli (an italian priest and architect) and was richly decorated. 

After the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Madrid_(1750)"">Treaty of Madrid</a> (signed in 1750 by Portugal and Spain), the reduction was partly destructed by armies, then abandoned and pillaged.

-----------------------------------

Sítio arqueológico da redução jesuíta de São Miguel Arcanjo, declarado 
Patrimônio Mundial da Humanidade em 1983 pela UNESCO. Está localizado na cidade de São Miguel das Missões-RS. 

Embora a redução tenha sido fundada no final do Séc. XVII, a construção da nave principal iniciou-se em 1735 e durou 10 anos. A igreja, em puro  estilo barroco, foi construída em pedra grés pelos guaranis e jesuítas, seguindo o projeto de Gean Battista Primoli (um padre e arquiteto italiano) e era ricamente decorada.

Após as conseqüências do <a href=""http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tratado_de_Madri"">Tratado de Madrid</a> (assinado por Portugal e Espanha em 1750) para o território dos Sete Povos das Missões, a redução entrou em decadência, num misto de destruição armada, desocupação, seguido, a partir do Século XIX, por saques da população local e gradual abandono.

We also informed the ranger that the sign was incorrect and that Titus Canyon was CLOSED due to the risk of flash flooding, having just been there 1 hour before.  She was appreciative.

"Well I had an interesting day yesterday (as did many others in the UK).  I was working out of the Newbury Business Park yesterday (not my usual place of work), it had been raining (and raining *hard*) since I woke up at 5am.  News filtered through the office at about 1pm or a little earlier that Vodafone's HQ has been evacuated as it was flooded and had lost power.  People were being sent home as if they couldn't get home now they would definitely not be able to later.

So I decided to bugger off once it was likely that everyone would be sent home.  Stood at the bus stop for 20mins waiting for the VF shuttle bus but nothing.  I could hear police and ambulance sirens going back and forth.   The guy next to me had been there for 40mins so definitely something was wrong as they are normally bang on time.  The rain stopped just before 2pm so I chose to walk to the train station and by walking around the corner I could see why there were no buses - cars, lots of them, not moving at all all the way down the A4!  On route to Newbury station a colleague walking by said Thatcham station was completely under water so I headed for Newbury station to check if I could get home but found this...

You can just about see the track, so that's a whole lot of water.  Guess what, I had to walk home (<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/koltregaskes/863303545/"">next pic</a>)...

"Oeiras Garden, 48 hours after the flood. Water coming from Laje river covered this area and flower beds were destroyed. Everything was covered by mud. Firemen have been cleaning the garden but it is not ready to be completely re-opened yet. Many trees have to be removed.

Most of the stray cats I've been photographing used to live here. I don't know if they survived.  We can't go to this part of the garden yet.

O Jardim Municipal de Oeiras, 48 horas depois das inundações. A ribeira da Laje extravasou e cobriu esta zona. Os canteiros de flores ficaram destruídos. Tudo ficou coberto de lama.

"Seven hundred years ago, several families of farmers lived in a collection of adobe and sandstone homes in a south-facing alcove in Upper Salt Creek, a 35-mile long canyon in what is now Canyonlands National Park. A spring once flowed from the cliff near their alcove, and water was abundant in the canyon. The wide floor of the canyon bottom allowed them to plant crops.

These families lived a life that was in some ways hard. The high desert is subject to drought and they endured exceptional heat in the summer and bitter cold in the winter. The ecology is fragile, and their use of wood for fire and building denuded the landscape and increased problems of erosion and flooding. As the environment deteriorated, many families in other parts of the canyon and throughout the region began to fear for their security and built their homes in alcoves high on the cliffs, accessible only with ladders that they could retract into the alcove at night.

But their lives were also rich in many ways, and much better than the lives of many contemporaneous people living in other parts of the world. They had a sophisticated agrarian economy, cultivating squash and corn, among other things, and storing their crop in sealed adobe granaries. They hunted bighorn and deer and small game. They created beautiful homes, decorated with traditional and religious designs. They painted the world around them, from their cookware to the walls of the canyons in which they lived. They painted the cycles of the moon and the rotation of their crops.

The family that lived in this small alcove in Upper Salt Creek grew squash in the garden they tended in front of their home. They ground the squash and corn on metates to make flour that could be stored throughout the winter.

When they left Salt Creek as part of a general migration away from the Colorado Plateau (perhaps due to drought, warfare, or a deteriorating environment), they left the garden behind, and they left remnant seeds in their granaries and middens.

Fed by the underground water source beneath their alcove, their squash garden has renewed itself for seven hundred consecutive years. Every year the big, leafy plants grow from seed; every year they produce squash, which are broken open and sometimes carried away by small animals. 

Today, in the fall, you can visit what remains of the home these families left behind and see the squash growing in their garden. You can see the faint remains of the pictures they painted on the walls of the alcove and imagine the fields of corn they tended on the flat sandy bottom of the canyon, now covered with sage and blackbrush. And you can see the squash fruit that will renew the garden for one more year.","['ancestral puebloan', 'backpacking', 'canyonlands national park', 'needles district', 'salt creek canyon', 'squash garden', 'squash garden house']",Squash Garden House,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,44792728@N00,jpg,-109.75831,2970387183,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1224917025,2008-10-21 16:20:23.0,38.03687,http://www.flickr.com/photos/44792728@N00/2970387183/,superfluity,Canon PowerShot G9

"Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket in Willowbrook (1946). It was a popular lunch stop along Route 66. The story goes that two women entered a gas station in 1938, offering to trade their recipe for fried chicken in exchange for a promise to use their chickens to make it. The Chicken Basket originally operated out of this gas station at a lunch counter, but became popular enough to warrant a new building in 1946. During winters, owner Irv Kolarik would flood the roof of the restaurant and hire local youths to skate on top of it.","['1940s', 'dupage county', 'eugene f. stoyke', 'illinois', 'restaurant', 'route 66']",Dell Rhea's Chicken Basket,Attribution-ShareAlike License,43943756@N07,jpg,-87.939215,5978659272,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/,1311701288,2010-05-23 12:26:44.0,41.745557,http://www.flickr.com/photos/43943756@N07/5978659272/,Teemu008,Canon PowerShot SD1200 IS

"Built in 1904 at the foot of Horseshoe Falls, opened in 1905 and closed in 1999.

The Ontario Power Company hydro-electric generating plant also opened in 1905. This American based company built its generating plant at the base of the Horseshoe Falls just above river level.

Water enters this generating station from an inlet located one mile upstream of the Falls near Dufferin Islands and is brought to the plant through buried conduit pipes and steel penstocks tunneled through the rock.

The fifteen generators produced 203,000 horsepower (132,500 kilowatts) of 25 cycle electric power. This plant has twice been flooded by ice and water in 1909 and 1938 putting it out of service each time for many months.

"<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66"" rel=""nofollow"">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Route_66</a>

La Route 66 (officiellement U.S. Route 66) était une route américaine qui joignait Chicago dans l'Illinois à Los Angeles en Californie (plus exactement, à Santa Monica).
Elle est longue de 2 448 miles (environ 4 000 km). La Route 66 traverse 8 États (Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Nouveau-Mexique, Arizona, Californie) et le point central se trouve à Adrian, dans le Texas. Elle fut la première route trans-continentale goudronnée en Amérique, il est donc peu surprenant que les Américains l'appellent la Mother Road ou Main Street USA. Elle a été officiellement déclassée le 27 juin 1985.
Si la Route 66 n'a plus d'existence « officielle », elle conserve un caractère mythique et est sans doute la plus connue des routes américaines. Il existe désormais des mouvements pour sa préservation, et les initiatives visant à y développer le tourisme sont de plus en plus nombreuses (ainsi, la route est à nouveau fléchée à plusieurs endroits sous le nom « Historic Route 66 »). Un exemple de la célébrité de cette route est qu'elle a une place très importante dans le film de John Lasseter, Cars. De plus, elle est un des lieux principaux de l'action du grand roman de John Steinbeck, Les raisins de la colère. 

 HISTOIRE : 

L'itinéraire a été commissionné en 1926, utilisant autant que possible des portions de routes existantes. À l'époque, la route n'est revêtue que sur 800 de ses 2 448 miles. Ce n'est qu'en 1937, notamment grâce à la politique du New Deal lancée par le président Franklin Delano Roosevelt, que la route est revêtue de Chicago à Los Angeles.

Pendant son heure de gloire, la Route 66 recevra de nombreux surnoms. La National US 66 Highway Association, qui se charge de populariser la route auprès du grand public, la nommera ""Main Street of America"", une appellation justifiée par le fait que la Route 66 faisait office de rue principale dans la plupart des villes qu'elle traversait. John Steinbeck la baptisera ""The Mother Road"" (la ""Route-Mère""), car toutes les routes secondaires débouchaient sur la Route 66. Plus tard, elle recevra le nom de ""Will Rogers Highway"", en mémoire de l'acteur.

Durant l'après-guerre, la Route 66 constitue un itinéraire majeur autour duquel se développent de nombreuses villes comme Amarillo (au Texas), Albuquerque (au Nouveau-Mexique), Flagstaff et Kingman (en Arizona). Des centaines de motels, de cafés, de stations-services, d'attractions touristiques et autres boutiques de souvenirs (""curio shops"") s'établissent le long de la route.

Très impressionné par le réseau autoroutier allemand (Autobahn), le président Eisenhower lance en 1954 le ""President’s Advisory Committee on a National Highway Program"", dont l'objectif est de réfléchir à la mise en place d'un réseau autoroutier moderne sur tout le territoire américain. Deux ans plus tard, les budgets sont votés et les premiers ""Interstates"" mis en chantier. Avec le développement des autoroutes, la Route 66 perd de son utilité. Là où elle subsiste (de nombreux tronçons ont été repris pour construire les autoroutes), son usage redevient majoritairement local. En 1984, le dernier segment de la 66 est « court-circuité » à Williams en Arizona.
Tous les petits commerces et villages qui vivaient de la 66 ont été abandonnés, figés dans le temps. D'innombrables villes fantômes longent ainsi la vieille route, toujours ouverte au voyageur aventurier.","['5d', 'architecture', 'building', 'chicago', 'downtown', 'loop', 'pedestrian', 'piéton', 'road 66', 'route 66', 'rue', 'street', 'worker']","Chicago (ILL) Near West Side, West Jackson Blvd ( Road 66 ) "" pedestrians """,Attribution License,44613506@N07,jpg,-87.639827,4826227478,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1280041903,2010-06-09 14:34:27.0,41.878076,http://www.flickr.com/photos/44613506@N07/4826227478/,(vincent desjardins),Canon EOS 5D

"I'm really taken with these statues.  Their spectacular state of disrepair gives them an air of antiquity that is not found in the same way at some of the more comprehensively restored sites around here.

The so-called Colossi of Memnon are two 18 metre tall seated statues, actually of the 18th Dynasty Pharoah Amenhotep III.  They originally guarded the entrance to his mortuary temple complex, facing East towards the river Nile, where the ceremonial entrance from the river to the temple would have been.  They look towards modern Luxor, Egypt (the ancient city of Thebes) on the East bank.   

The complex was of staggering size, but the combination of millennia of flooding and later robbing of stone have left these as the only visible remnant.

The Southern statue (here on the left) is carved from a single piece of sandstone.  The other one originally matched it, but was all-but destroyed by an earthquake in the first century AD.  At the same time, there began to be reports of an occasional noise coming from the shattered remnant of this statue around dawn.  Some time in the 3rd century AD, Roman engineers reconstructed the statue, replacing the missing top half.  They used the carved sandstone blocks that can be seen here laid in courses, giving this satue a striking appearance..  Whatever they did, the noise stopped and has never reliably been reported since.

The association with Memnon (the very same legendary hero of the Trojan War on the Trojan side) is spurious.  It may have been conjured up when the dawn noise began to be heard, long after the name of the original builder was forgotten.","['2009', 'amenhotep', 'carved', 'colossi', 'colossus', 'egypt', 'eqypt', 'holiday', 'iii', 'luxor', 'memnon', 'mortuary', 'necropolis', 'nile', 'pharoah', 'ruins', 'sandstone', 'seated', 'statue', 'stone', 'temple', 'thebes', 'voice']",The Colossi of Memnon,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,32974871@N00,jpg,32.6109,3469708108,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1240528182,2009-04-03 12:44:14.0,25.7202,http://www.flickr.com/photos/32974871@N00/3469708108/,electropod,Canon EOS 400D DIGITAL

"Arno river, Florence, Italy

The Arno is a river in the Tuscany region of Italy. It is the most important river of central Italy after the Tiber.

It crosses Florence, where it passes below the Ponte Vecchio and the Santa Trìnita bridge (built by Bartolomeo Ammanati, but inspired by Michelangelo). The river flooded this city regularly in historical times, the last occasion being the famous flood of 1966, with 4,500 m³/s after rainfall of 437.2 millimetres (17.21 in) in Badia Agnano and 190 millimetres (7.5 in) in Florence, in only 24 hours.

The flow rate of the Arno is irregular. It is sometimes described as having a torrent-like behaviour, because it can easily go from almost dry to near-flood in a few days. At the point where the Arno leaves the Apennines, flow measurements can vary between 0.56 m³/s and 3,540 m³/s. New dams built upstream of Florence have greatly alleviated the problem in recent years.","['arno', 'beautiful', 'blinkagain', 'bridge', 'calm', 'firenze', 'florence', 'italia', 'italy', 'nikonflickraward', 'river', 'scenic', 'tiber', 'tuscany']","Arno river, Florence, Italy",Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,25509772@N00,jpg,11.247167,2713256533,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1217342120,2004-04-11 17:31:47.0,43.770845,http://www.flickr.com/photos/25509772@N00/2713256533/,Eustaquio Santimano,SONY DSC-V1

"Spotted this little guy standing along the road, HWY 163 near the Mayfield Store.  He acted like he was week and a little wobbly on his feet but had enough strength to hiss, growl, and make a few quick jumps at our feet and cameras.  It was not much bigger than a big guinea pig and I'm sure was too young to be on it's own.  There were heavy rains in the area earlier and we speculated he may have been seperated from the family by flooding or even scattered by the traffic that seemed to be extra heavy along the road that night or early morning.  Right before we left him he was doing that little raccoon purring that tugged at the heart as if it was telling me he was lost and scared and did not know what to do.  It is hard to walk away praying it's mother will find it and life will continue.  Unfortunately, only a couple of hundred yards further down the road we spotted another one of the same size that had very recently been run over by a vehicle.","['hwy 163', 'mammal', 'raccoon', 'texas', 'tx', 'val', 'verde']","Raccoon, Baby",Attribution-ShareAlike License,20087733@N00,jpg,,179494281,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/,1151812724,2006-07-01 04:06:54.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/20087733@N00/179494281/,Charles & Clint,

"Ealy in the morning I woke up and went out to get wood for the three prieplaces in the house. While Jeroen was slowly waking up and Rajesz was exploring the neigbourhood, I drove to Boleslawiec to welcome our Dutch friends in Poland. There was a lot of snow on the road and the hilly road near the farm was pretty slippery, even with winter tires. They all looked very happy and excited when they came out of the train. For most of them it was the first time in Poland and they had had lots of fun during the night train trip. Part of the group took the bus, they liked the adventure. My daughter Eva , her friend Emily and our friend Corine joined me in the car with the luggage. We had a large brunch together and then went out for a hike through the forests and fields. Although Rajesh was reading a very detailed map, we kind of lost our way as we did not walk on the path but simply straight through the bushes. As we crossed a little river my shoe broke through the ice and was totally wet. But that was all part of the fun and experience. By the fire we eat barszcz, zurek and pierogy. While we played a game called ""Weiber Abend"" (female night), a stranger knocked the door. This guy had to walk another 20 km to get home and he wanted to get warm. So I let him in but found out he was pretty drunk. So after some hot coffee I kindly wished him a good trip home.

"Richmond bridge looks old, the only clue we managed to find was that the iron benches set into bays along the bridge - were made in 1868. The bridge was really busy with vehicles and pedestrians. A nice bridge but it was a relief to be walking away from it. Richmond by the river on a sunny Sunday afternoon is not a place for peace and quiet. We walked back along the south bank to Richmond Lock.

Built in 1777

I could go on, and on - I blew out my battery every day and we generally had good weather.  (And, in fact, I posted a few images of other works at my ""Berkeley_Bunward"" site, including a construction site for a building by the Japanese architect Toyo Ito and a wonderful renovation that just opened. I put another one there for Stephen, too.)  But I know this is a lot.  I would love to find out if you got something out of these...

"Strangely named (but somehow appropriate) lane. Always floods when there is rain. There is often (as there was to-day) someone stuck either half-way down or on one side of the other (having ground to a halt). It's not <i>that</i> deep to-day but it does go on quite a long way and it's difficult to see where (the very boggy) edge is. I didn't risk it.

The area is notorious for it's floods (some good photos <a href=""http://www.team-triplet.com/TTSite/2007SL01.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and a video of some off-roaders tackling it in full spate <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHugE1njLJ8"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> and someone driving along it when the whole road is flooded - <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K048xL5b9uI"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>).

The figure in the distance is Ned Jnr. who couldn't resist a quick wade (""just to check how deep it is"").

"Río de janiero, Brazil 

 Day one, Río, beach, in my bikini, humid, cloudy and then finally, rainy. And my friends wondered why I wasn´t more tan when I got back to Uruguay. Bianca jokingly said that Leo had brought the rain from Sao Paulo. What we didn´t know was that about 5 days later Río would be flooded with rain water. That Sunday night it began to rain and didn´t stop until Tuesday morning. Over 100 people died in the city of Río because of the flooding. All the people that died were  living in the slums, which are built on the dangerously unstable sediments of the Río hills....... 




 PS. On a lighter note: Those coconut things are super bomb-diggity. They keep them in little fridges to chill the coconut water and then chisle a little hole at one end to put in a straw. After you guzzle down all that delicious coconut water, they break it open and you can eat the coconut meat :) super good and nothing like those brown coconuts you find in US grocery stores.",[],he brought the rain,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,46451138@N04,jpg,,4575372753,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1272915324,2010-03-29 20:56:34.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/46451138@N04/4575372753/,LaIda(H),Canon EOS 50D

"The aqueduct at Canada Larga Road is two surviving sections of viaduct about 100 feet long and made of cobble stone and mortar. Originally, the watercourse ran from a point on the Ventura River about 1/2 mile north of the remaining ruins and carried the water to holding tanks behind the San Buenaventura Mission, a total of about 7 miles. The aqueduct was built by Chumash Indians 1805-15 to meet the needs of the mission population and consisted of both ditches and elevated stone masonry. The entire water system was destroyed by floods and abandoned in 1862.

"Horning Ferry,Horning, Norfolk

The Horning Ferry Drainage Pump is a local Landmark,on the banks of The River Bure.

For many years the broads were regarded as natural features of the landscape. It was only in the 1960s that Dr Joyce Lambert proved that they were artificial features, the effect of flooding on early peat excavations. The Romans first exploited the rich peat beds of the area for fuel, and in the Middle Ages the local monasteries began to excavate the peat lands as a business, selling fuel to Norwich and Great Yarmouth. The Cathedral took 320,000 tones of peat a year. Then the sea levels began to rise, and the pits began to flood. Despite the construction of wind pumps and dykes, the flooding continued and resulted in the typical Broads landscape of today, with its reed beds, grazing marshes and wet woodland.
In The 1800’s there were 240  wind pumps on The Broads.Only 70 remain,most of which are derelict.
In the 1930’s Horning Ferry Wind Pump was converted to a 3 Bedroom house.It is now used as holiday accommodation.","['abigfave', 'dmc-tz3', 'england', 'flickrdiamond', 'horning', 'horning ferry', 'my_gear_and_me_premium', 'mywinners', 'naturesfinest', 'norfolk', 'norfolk broads', 'photosandcalendar', 'supershot', 'thebestofmimamorsgroups', 'thegalaxy', 'theoriginalgoldseal', 'wind pump']",Horning Ferry Wind Pump,Attribution License,23604354@N02,jpg,1.468171,4927515895,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1282781370,2010-08-18 14:12:01.0,52.696452,http://www.flickr.com/photos/23604354@N02/4927515895/,john47kent,Panasonic DMC-TZ3

"Connequenessing - ""Can't Canoe""

And why would you want to canoe in this 1 foot deep, always flooding, raging river? It's scary and you never know where it will take you, or if you'll end up face down in muddy water. 

Or maybe that's the thrill of it all. Let the river take it where it may, and you enjoy the beauty of it while you can. You can trust it to take you somewhere better, or you can turn your back, and always wonder where the river would've dropped you off.","['risks', 'river', 'water']",Connequenessing River,Attribution License,57612774@N06,jpg,-80.263559,5698126754,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1304820164,2011-05-07 12:38:10.0,40.868231,http://www.flickr.com/photos/57612774@N06/5698126754/,kschemp,LG Electronics LG-C900

"The Michigan Municipal League represents cities, villages and urban townships throughout Michigan. We’re constantly visiting communities all over our great state and often post photos of the placemaking assets we find that make Michigan economically vibrant once again. Placemaking is about building communities where people want to live work and play. Practicing what it preaches, the League created the Center for 21st Century Communities: <a href=""http://www.mml.org/resources/21c3/about.html"" rel=""nofollow"">www.mml.org/resources/21c3/about.html</a>. This program identifies eight assets that make for vibrant communities. Those eight assets are physical design and walkability, green initiatives, cultural and economic development, entrepreneurship, multiculturalism, messaging and technology, transit and education. The League traveled to Grand Rapids during ArtPrize in October 2012 because the city and ArtPrize (<a href=""http://www.artprize.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">www.artprize.org/</a>) show several of these assets at work. ArtPrize in just a few short years has become one of Michigan’s premiere events. Check out the many sights and sounds of ArtPrize and in this photo set on flickr. The League’s 2011  Convention was in Grand Rapids during ArtPrize and you can check out the 2011 ArtPrize photos here (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michigancommunities/sets/72157627893874680/with/6244005425/"">www.flickr.com/photos/michigancommunities/sets/7215762789...</a>) and 2011 Convention photos here: <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/michigancommunities/collections/72157627705852141/"">www.flickr.com/photos/michigancommunities/collections/721...</a>.

"The scene in Joplin, many months after the tornado devastated the town, seems stalled. FEMA pulled out when Hurrincane Irene came up the coast of the eastern seaboard, we were told by the inspectors we spoke to on the scene. The high school, (second building on the right) is not going to be rebuilt due to being located in a flood plain. The house you see in white, with red roof, has been rebuilt in that flood plain, in defiance of the new rules. That owner has been told to remove the house. You might or might not be able to make out that there are some holes here where houses used to stand. The other buildings here have been left in rubble, perhaps due to the owners having no insurance money with which to rebuild.

"<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oudegracht"" rel=""nofollow"">From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</a>

The Oudegracht, or ""old canal"", runs through the centre of Utrecht, the Netherlands. It starts in the southeast of the city. Here the Kromme Rijn (the original main bed of the Rhine river) and the Vaartse Rijn (a medieval canal reconnecting Utrecht to the newer main stream of the Rhine, the Lek) arrive to meet the original moat of the fortified town, and the Oudegracht goes from there into the center of town. Parts of the Oudegracht follow the original flow of the river Rhine, but there is some disagreement on what parts. The northern part is most likely an early canal (app. 1000) connecting the Rhine section to the river Vecht. The southern part was started in 1122, after the water level of the Rhine in Utrecht dropped because of the new dam at Wijk bij Duurstede. The ground excavated was used to raise the sides of the canal, to reduce the chance of flooding. When the city's system of locks was finished in 1275 the water level was constant, enabling the creation of permanently dry cellars and new quays at water level, hence the typical wharfs (Dutch: werven) below street level. Warehouses used to line the canal. Today many of these warehouses have been converted into restaurants and cafés.




De Oudegracht is de bekendste gracht in de Nederlandse stad Utrecht. De ongeveer twee kilometer lange gracht is te beschouwen als het verbindingsstuk tussen de Kromme Rijn en de Vecht en doorsnijdt de gehele binnenstad van zuid naar noord. Eeuwenlang is zij de hoofdader van de stad geweest. De werven en werfkelders van de Utrechtse Oude- en Nieuwegracht zijn uniek in de wereld.

"The Ostend terminus, designed by architects P. J. Otten and F. Seulen, is the largest train station on the Belgian coast, and the city's sole station since the old central — damaged in WWII — was torn down in 1956.

Originally built as the city's quay station to service ferries crossing to Dover, it was inaugurated on August 1, 1913, as the Oostende-Kaai station, replacing an earlier wooden structure built in 1904.

The station's train shed, and the arch spanning its arrivals hall (furthest right in the picture), were irreparably damaged in the first year of WWI.  While the shed was never rebuilt, the arrivals hall received a flat roof in 1920.

The former Hôtel Terminus Maritime (closed in the 1960s) is attached to the station, and its main floor houses a royal reception room (now the station master's office).  The building has been listed as protected since 1983.

Its somewhat worn appearance recalls not only the reign of King Albert I (whose cypher can be spotted on the façade) but also the days when the Orient Express would call on its way to Istanbul via Vienna.","['2010', 'architecture', 'belgïe', 'belgique', 'belgium', 'railways railway station railway', 'station public', 'transport', 'vloandern flandre-occidentale westflandern oostende ostende ostend natiënkaai sncb nmbs belgian', 'west flanders', 'west-vlaanderen west']",Station Oostende.,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,44940127@N08,jpg,2.925481,6277225895,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1319485743,2010-09-22 16:37:36.0,51.22922,http://www.flickr.com/photos/44940127@N08/6277225895/,Pestpruf,Canon EOS DIGITAL REBEL XT

MEAT: thick, stiff in the handle, the hat softer. The hat pale yellow color on the handle more distinct yellow color, basically daring red-brown. At the intersection of the flood only hat in the handle remains unchangeable yellow color. In places where the handle was damaged, looms the yellow color. The smell and taste is very pleasant, fruity odor reminiscent of perfume.
MICROSCOPY: spores yellowish, elliptical fusiform, 10-15 x 4-5 um.
Habitats and extent: in deciduous forests on limestone warmer ground, especially with oak and beech. In the lowlands is not growing, represented in the mountainous and subalpine zone. Very rare fungus grows most often in groups of several pieces, rarely individually.
Edibility: edible mushroom on probation, before use should be thermally processed because the raw mildly toxic.
The growing period: from the beginning of summer, the beginning of autumn.
SIMILAR SPECIES: amazing double is the type of Boletus rubrosanguineus (Wälty) ex Cheype, which grows at higher elevations in coniferous forests (spruce and fir). Rhodoxanthus while a young pink-grayish shade hat, and rubrosanguineus without significant impurities or slightly rose-colored, but is more grayish okerzelenkast, and how old it turns red while rhodoxanthus remain still pink or even fade. Some of the yellow-purple mushroom perhaps mixed in with loony bin (Boletus satanas), but nuthouse almost never has Noci tones per hat and has an unpleasant odor. There is a great similarity with the type of Boletus rhodopurpureus Smotlacha, but his hat to the pressure changes color to a dark blue flesh and flooding at the intersection, and the handle.
NOTE: One of the most beautiful mushrooms of the genus Boletus, a very pleasant smell. Very rare fungus.",[],BOLETUS RHODOXANTUS  (Krombh.)

"July 4, 1908.

From the website...
<a href=""http://www.glenelder.com/waconda_springs.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">www.glenelder.com/waconda_springs.htm</a>

Based on fact and legend, Waconda Lake inherited its name from a prominent, historical site called Waconda Springs, which was located about half-way between Glen Elder and Cawker City, 3/4 of a mile south of old U.S. Highway 24. The mineral springs was an interesting phenomena on the plains of north central Kansas. Its pool basin was set in a 300-foot-wide mound rising 40 feet above the surrounding Solomon  River Valley. The spring's pool was 50 feet in diameter and 15 feet deep, although there is a myth that the pool was  bottomless. The water contained calcium, magnesium, iron, silica, sodium chloride, sulfate, and bicarbonate. Geologists thought that the mound was formed by the deposits of minerals forced up by artesian pressure in the water.

The mineral springs around which the legend evolved was once a ceremonial gathering place sacred to all the plains Indians. Later it became a health resort for the white man until Lake Waconda covered the site.

According to learned sources the word Wakonda with a ""k"" was actually a word used by the Kanza Indians to denote the supernatural, roughly translated, ""great spirit."" (Later, as more white men settled the area, the name ""Waconda"" with a ""c"" became the standard spelling of the word.)

The Indians believed the water to have healing powers. Practically every Indian tribe visited the site at one time or another including the Pawnee, Wichita, Kaw, Kiowa, Sioux, Arapaho, Comanche, the Miami, the Crow, and others. The Cheyenne and the Arapaho were the last tribes who roamed the plains around the Springs and the Solomon River Valley--a neutral area where all Indian tribes would come to worship the ""Great Spirit"" on their annual migration with the buffalo herds.

The Legend

There are several legends surrounding the ""Great Spirit Spring,"" however, the following is probably the most true.

Wakonda was the beautiful daughter of an Indian chief. From the beginning, the elders of the tribe knew it was unwise for the chief to name his daughter after a god, which is what they considered the spring to be. As Wakonda grew older, she liked to wander the countryside. One day she came upon an injured warrior. After a short conversation, they realized they were from enemy tribes, but that did not stop Wakonda from nursing him back to health. The warrior's name was Takota, the son of the opposing chief. Eventually, he regained his strength and went to Wakonda's father to ask for her hand in marriage.

Harsh words were spoken and a battle was fought around the springs. Takota was standing near the edge of the spring when one of warriors of Wakonda's father shot an arrow that hit Takota Mortally wounded, he fell into the springs as he died. Heartbroken, Wakonda dove into the water after him calling to the gods to give back her lover. She never resurfaced. The warriors drew back in awe, and to this day it is believed that the spirit of Wakonda dwelled in the Spring, and perhaps even still in the place of its namesake--Waconda Lake.

From the facts gathered regarding the early history of Waconda Springs, it is learned that the first white man to visit this historic spot was Sir William Johnson in the spring of 1767. The first recorded Kansas history dealing with Waconda Springs tells of the visit by General Zebulon Pike in the year 1814. General Pike, on his trek westward visited an Indian village now known as Guide Rock. During his visit, he learned of what the Indians called the ""Great Spirit Spring,"" a place where for generations Indians had gathered in respect of a Great Spirit. Pike altered his route and visited Waconda Springs on his way to Colorado where he discovered Pike's Peak. The last great pilgrimage of the Indians to the ""Great Spirit Springs"" was in the early 1870s. 

The first permanent habitation at the Springs was a sod house built in 1870 by a man named Pfeifer who took out the first claim on the property. A few years later, history  recalls, a man named Burnham who established a bottling works on the site and started the sale and distribution of Waconda Flier, which became known simply as WacondaSodHouse-1a.jpg (139967 bytes) Water. Burnham raised the interest of a man by the name of McWilliams, an eastern capitalist, who in turn invested in the site. In addition, in 1884, he constructed the stone structure in which the sanitarium group started. It was completed 10 years later. For several years, the place operated as a  hotel and resort, the proprietor being G. W. Cooper. During this time, the distribution of Waconda Flier extended to all parts of the country.    

In 1906, Dr. G. P. Abrahams, who had operated a bathhouse at Mankato, Kansas, for many years, purchased the property from McWilliams. Abrahams was well acquainted with the extraordinary qualities and advantages of the Great Spirit Spring. (The water had won a medal for mineral waters of superior medicinal qualities at the 1904 St. Louis Fair.) He moved his family to the Springs in November of the same year.

The future owner of the site, Dr. Carl Bingesser, a member of the Intelligence 'Department of the United States army, visited Waconda Springs around Thanksgiving time in 1906. In June the following year, after duty in Dallas, San Francisco, and the Philippine Islands, he was transferred to St. Louis, Mo. In September of that year, he married Anna Abrahams, Dr. G. P. Abrahams' daughter. Dr. and Mrs. Sanitarium-1a.jpg (155327 bytes)Bingesser resided in St. Louis until April 1908, then they returned to Waconda Springs to make their permanent home.

During the years between 1906, when Dr. Abrahams purchased the institution, and 1924, the year of his death, many improvements and expansions were made. Likewise, after his death, the Bingessers who took over the operation, all for the benefit and relief of ailing and health-seeking people, constantly added improvements and facilities. For many years, it stood as a modern institution to which people from all over the nation came to be relieved of their sufferings. It also operated as a modern bottling plant from which Waconda Water was shipped to people all over the country.

Then in 1932 their son, the future Dr. Carlos Bingesser, was born at the springs. He, his wife, Marjorie, and their family continued to make improvements and forward the work of the institution. Over the years, the facilities offered physical and hydrotherapy, electric-therapy and dietary procedure. Water from the Spring was piped into every bathtub in the 60-room sanitarium. It was used in a program of internal and external body cleansing. Dr. Carlos used the slogan ""It will clean your works until your works work."" The scenic beauty with historical connections, as well as the health interest attracted many hundreds of people to the Springs annually.

Dr. Carlos dreamed of passing Waconda Springs Sanitarium on to his children, which would have made it a fourth generation spa. But his hopes were dashed when plans of a large earthen dam at Glen Elder, originally discussed in 1944, became reality. The reality of the matter was sealed after the 1951 flood devastated Topeka, Lawrence, Kansas City, and other towns. Demands for flood control was renewed.

Dr. Bingesser and others valiantly fought the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corp of Engineers in an effort to stop the project. His adversaries, however, just ran the place down and called it a ""mud hole."" A respected hydrologist inspected the Springs and testified that it was the only one like it in the world. The effort was fruitless, and the construction of the dam which began in 1964, was complete in December 1968. Compounding the loss of the irreplaceable landmark, the builders of the reservoir piled the remaining debris from the sanatorium into the Waconda Springs before it was covered by the waters of Waconda Lake. In the end, perhaps the ""Great Spirit,"" gained a new, more expansive home for its legend to continue.","['crowd', 'diver', 'july 4th', 'mineral springs', 'spectators', 'springs', 'waconda springs, kansas']","Waconda Springs, Kansas, Springs, Diver, July 4th",Attribution License,34897967@N08,jpg,-98.312927,6205586718,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/,1317596129,2011-10-02 17:55:29.0,39.503059,http://www.flickr.com/photos/34897967@N08/6205586718/,photolibrarian,

"I remember mercifully little about cricket except that games go on day after day, until someone wins, loses or draws.  Being a mine of useless information, I also know that cricket has Laws, of which <a href=""http://www.lords.org/laws-and-spirit/laws-of-cricket/laws/law-3-the-umpires,29,AR.html"">3.9</a> allows the umpires to suspend play if the light is ""not suitable.""  Incidentally, that link is worth following, if only to see a doofus showing how the ground crew marshal a plane into its parking slot.  If you’re British, you, like me, may know nothing at all about cricket except that ""bad light stopped play.""  I think it happens with tennis, too, but in the last minute or so my interest in these odd pastimes has abruptly reached a new low.  

I think that you can see where this is going.

So far my Spanish trip had been dogged by grey weather and rain. But now I was in France, and the south of France at that, a place whose sun and light is famous throughout the world.  This is why, at 09h30 on the dot, it clouded over and stayed clouded over, raining a bit now and then to relieve the monotony.

All the towns that are in the Michelin Guide are underlined on my Michelin map, just as all the pretty roads are rimmed in green.  Moissac is underlined; perhaps it is famous for its hand-crafted manhole covers, or its annual schnauzer-gliding contest, but I don’t really care.  Well, OK, it’s a World Heritage Site of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela – but isn’t everywhere?  I can no longer say that I’ve never been to Moissac, but bite me if I ever go again. 

From there north to Lauzerte and Montcuq its interesting country.  There would have been some great photos, including some good plantain avenues, had there been any light.  Montcuq, one of the stops on the pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostella, is a small mediaeval town, full of earnest-looking people with backpacks.  

Montcuq is the butt of many jokes – as is Pussy, a village whose sign I snapped last year.  This year in Spain I passed, in reverential admiration, a sign for Cuntis.

Since bad light had stopped play, I decided to go to Cahors to buy some jeans.  The ones I was wearing had this alluring aroma about them, and were probably older than my daughter.  Hell, they were probably older than my sister.  The pocket I use to keep my wallet in had developed an inconvenient trait – two major holes – and there was more ventilation between my legs than was seemly.  Reluctant as I am to cast aside old companions, I decided, nevertheless, to buy another pair.  But I arrived at Cahors at 12h35, and Cahors was shut until 14h00.

The D653 is an astonishing road.  In the middle of one of the most densely populated bits of the planet, this road streaks out for miles across the Causses du Quercy, a vast wilderness with (<i>mirabile dictum</i>) No People.  The sky was various shades of pearl grey.  I cut across country north of Figeac and south of Mauriac, through the Pas de Peyrol to end the day in Murat, deep in the Auvergne, on the southern flank of the great Massif du Cantal.  

It looked suspiciously like rain.  I couldn’t face another soggy start, so found a cheap hotel just before the heavens opened.  I’ve seldom seen a storm like it.  I was in a bar, looking out at the ankle-deep torrent that was the street, when I realised that a puppy-sized frog was sitting on the sidewalk looking back at me.  His drain was flooded, and he looked distinctly unhappy.  Even for him, bad weather had stopped play.

"Glastonbury Tor is a teardrop-shaped hill at Glastonbury, Somerset, England, which features the roofless St. Michael's Tower. The site is managed by the National Trust.

Tor is a local word of Celtic origin meaning 'conical hill'. The Tor has a striking location in the middle of a plain called the Summerland Meadows, part of the Somerset Levels. The plain is actually reclaimed fenland out of which the Tor rose like an island, but now, with the surrounding flats, is a peninsula washed on three sides by the River Brue. The remains of Glastonbury Lake Village were identified in 1892, showing that there was an Iron Age settlement about 300–200 BC on what was an easily defended island in the fens.[1][2] Earthworks and Roman remains prove later occupation. The spot seems to have been called Ynys yr Afalon by the Britons, and it is believed to be the Avalon of Arthurian legend.

The slopes of the Tor appear to be quite regularly terraced. Some believe that this formation is the remains of an ancient, perhaps Neolithic, sacred labyrinth.[3] Others attribute the terraces to natural ruts formed everywhere on grassy slopes by generations of grazing animals, which are slow to disappear if the grass cover is left undisturbed. The generally accepted explanation is terracing for farming, possibly by medieval monks.[4] Even after the wetlands were drained by the Monks of Glastonbury Abbey via their vast network of drainage canals, the risk of flooding on the plain meant that farm land was at a premium for anything other than grazing cattle.","['2007', 'dag 2', 'engeland', 'glastonbury', 'juli', 'meadows', ""michael's"", 'somerset', 'st.', 'summerland', 'tor', 'tower', 'vakantie', 'zuid-west']","Glastonbury Tor, St. Michael's Tower",Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,42221318@N00,jpg,-2.698438,926160058,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1185614481,2007-07-11 12:08:59.0,51.142599,http://www.flickr.com/photos/42221318@N00/926160058/,Antoon's Foobar,PENTAX Corporation PENTAX K10D

"Oxfam is providing bottled water for flood affected communities in Kinniya Division in Trincomalee District in the East. Food and drinking water are urgent priorities for the 1 million people affected by the floods in Sri Lanka. 

Oxfam has been supporting flood-affected communities in Sri Lanka since the start of the disaster. Oxfam and partners are currently reaching more than 17,000 people with non-food items, food and water assistance, hygiene kits, mosquito nets, mats and tarpaulins.

We will be scaling up our response to the disaster to reach 120,000 people in the Eastern and North Central Provinces.

"The Romans were far smarter than later residents of Sommières! When they built a bridge across the Vidourle river in the 1st century, the bridge consisted of 17 arches, although most of the time the river only flowed through 5 of these. The Roman town was up on the hillside. They recognised that the flash floods of the Vidourle (""Vidourlades"" could be impressive!

In the Middle Ages, people began to build closer to the river, and even on the sides of the bridge, although they carefully laid out the streets like a chequerboard, to allow water to flow through the town. They built a gateway to the town close to the middle of the bridge, with a belfrey and clock tower. The ""ground floor"" of houses was used for storage. 

In 1745, an embankment was built along the river, in rpinciple, to hold back the floods - but in fact the water just flows round this, and into the town. In 1777, the fastest ""Vidourlade"" recorded to date saw a rise of 5 metres of water in half an hour!

Sommières suffers from flooding almost every year, with bad flooding every few years. On 9 September 2002 there was a particularly bad flood (into the first floor of many houses in the lower part of town; the fire station was flooded out - preventing the fire brigade from being able to go out and help!!!). In January this year, there were 3 Vidourlades ... not as bad as in 2002, but bad enough!","['beffroi', 'belfrey', 'bell-tower', 'clock', 'france', 'gard', 'horloge', 'languedoc-roussillon', 'portail', 'porte de la ville', 'roman bridge', 'rues', 'sculpture', 'sommières', 'streets']",Part of the Roman bridge in Sommières,Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,45306251@N00,jpg,4.090626,3351858863,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1236987499,2009-03-11 11:38:40.0,43.782922,http://www.flickr.com/photos/45306251@N00/3351858863/,Anduze traveller,Canon EOS 20D

"These iconic words in Dorothea Mackellar's own hand, look out over the arboretum - a magnificent new treasure growing in our nations capital.

The love of field and coppice,
Of green and shaded lanes.
Of ordered woods and gardens
Is running in your veins,
Strong love of grey-blue distance
Brown streams and soft dim skies
I know but cannot share it,
My love is otherwise.

I love a sunburnt country,
A land of sweeping plains,
Of ragged mountain ranges,
Of droughts and flooding rains.
I love her far horizons,
I love her jewel-sea,
Her beauty and her terror –
<b>The wide brown land for me!</b>

A stark white ring-barked forest
All tragic to the moon,
The sapphire-misted mountains,
The hot gold hush of noon.
Green tangle of the brushes,
Where lithe lianas coil,
And orchids deck the tree-tops
And ferns the warm dark soil.


Core of my heart, my country!
Her pitiless blue sky,
When sick at heart, around us,
We see the cattle die -
But then the grey clouds gather,
And we can bless again
The drumming of an army,
The steady, soaking rain.

Core of my heart, my country!
Land of the Rainbow Gold,
For flood and fire and famine,
She pays us back threefold -
Over the thirsty paddocks,
Watch, after many days,
The filmy veil of greenness
That thickens as we gaze.

An opal-hearted country,
A wilful, lavish land -
All you who have not loved her,
You will not understand -
Though earth holds many splendours,
Wherever I may die,
I know to what brown country
My homing thoughts will fly.

"Glasgow City Center- The home of architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Glasgow boast sandstone Victorian building that have been lovingly restored. 
This important ship building center, 27 miles from Glasgow, was the birthplace of James Watt, a pioneer in the development of the steam engine. Lyle Hill, behind the town provides an excellent vantage point, affording a wide view of the Clyde estuary from Helensburgh right round to Dunoon. The Custom House Museum, on the quay north of Greenock Central train station, traces the history of the Customs & Excise service. The Mclean Museum & Art Gallery, west of the town center, charts the history of steam power and Clyde shipping. Greenock is also your gateway to Glasgow. Over the years Glasgow's traditional beauty has been lovingly restored, revealing the most exquisite Victorian city in the United Kingdom. You'll marvel at its masterful architecture, such as the City Chambers, and the elegant Princess Square makes for excellent shopping. Glasgow retains some of the finest museums and galleries in Europe, including the magnificent Burrell Collection, where you'll find a treasure trove of priceless paintings and art objects. Although Scotland and England have been united since 1707, this country retains its own unique character, including legal and educational systems quite distinct from those of England. Reminders of Scotland's Celtic past can be found across the land, from ancient hill forts to powerful symbolic stones, and their influence lives on in Scottish music, poetry, language and traditions.

"Świątynia Svetitskhoveli w miejscowości Mtskheta to jedno z najważniejszych miejsc kultu religijnego w Gruzji. Wybudowana została w miejscu, gdzie wg. legendy pochowana została siostra Sidonia wraz z tuniką Jezusa Chrystusa. Pierwszy kościół w tym miejscu zbudowano w IV wieku naszej ery, natomiast kamienną świątynię wybudowano w 420 roku naszej ery. Kościół wielokrotnie był niszczony i odbudowywany i ze względu na swoją niezwykle bogatą historię jest wpisany na listę światowego dziedzictwa kulturowego UNESCO.

14 października przypada święto tej świątyni - Svetichowsloba, poświęcone także życiodajnemu cudownemu pniu drzewa, które wyrosło z grobu Sidonii. Setki Gruzinów w tym dniu zjeżdżają się by zapalić świecę w świątyni, zmówić modlitwę w swych intencjach i wysłuchać słów  jego Świątobliwości Arcybiskupa Mtskhety-Tbilisi i Katolikosa-Patriarchy całej Gruzji - Eliasza II. W tym dniu drogi do miasteczka są zamknięte, wypełnione po brzegi marszrutki wysadzają pielgrzymów przy wjeździe do miasta, a świątynia otoczona jest przez tłumy oczekujące na wejście do środka.

The Svetitskhoveli temple in Mtskheta is one of the most important cult places in Georgia. Built in the place of the tomb of sister Sidonia, who died with the tunic of Jesus Christ in her hands. The first wooden temple was built in the IV century A.D., the first stone temple was constructed 420 A.D. The building was many times destroyed and rebuilt. For its historical value it has been listed on the world cultural heritage list of UNESCO. 

On the 14th of October the temple has its holiday - Svetichowsloba, dedicated to the miraculous tree that grew on Sidonias grave. Hundreds of Georgians come to Mtskheta on this day, to light a candle and carrying their prayer.

Curzon Street railway station (formerly Birmingham station) was used briefly for regular scheduled passenger services between 1838 and 1854 when it acted as the terminus for both the London and Birmingham Railway and the Grand Junction Railway, with lines connecting Birmingham to London and to Manchester and Liverpool respectively. It was then used for excursions until 1893 and goods traffic until 1966 when it closed. More recently, the surviving Grade I listed, entrance building has been used for occasional art events.

In 2010, a new Curzon Street station, partly on the site of the historical station was proposed as the Birmingham terminus for future High Speed London service.","['2011', '2011inphotos', '209-365', '365', '365 project', 'birmingham', 'building', 'curzon street', 'england', 'grade i', 'high speed', 'john garghan', 'july', 'listed', 'london railway', 'passenger', 'project', 'project365', 'railway station', 'uk', 'united kingdom', 'west midlands', 'year3']",209-365 Year3 Curzon Street Railway Station,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,21606164@N00,jpg,-1.886365,5999670275,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1312244257,2011-07-28 11:14:08.0,52.481532,http://www.flickr.com/photos/21606164@N00/5999670275/,johngarghan,Canon EOS 350D DIGITAL

"As recommended by a number of flickrfriends we took a little tour with 'Scary Mary.'

What an incredible tour guide 'Scary Mary' turned out to be.

The woman can really tell a story.

I know I've certainly met my match.

You guys were right on the money with the recommendation!

We all just fell in love with Mary right there.

She's got 'the magic' in her.

She really does.

Mary was really tickled to hear that she'd been spoken so highly of here .

She looked at me after only a few minutes and said 'we're gonna have trouble with this one.'

She's calls it like she sees it.

Mary's parents are from Minnesota... they fell in love in Chicago where Mary was conceived and they came down to New Orleans to have Mary.

She lives in the French Quarter and she stayed throughout Hurricane Katrina.

Two of her sons lost houses in the flooding.

She quickly pointed out that they were among the fortunate...

their homes were insured and they kept their jobs.

Mary only left a few days after the blow when the water was turned off to the homes in the French Quarter.

You ever get down to New Orleans you gotta get yourself onto one of 'Scary Mary's' walking tours.

I promise you you'll really dig this woman.

The girls loved her too.

She knows her stuff... she's feisty and funny and she'll really show you a good time.

When you're on a tour with her it seems like everyone she walks by knows her...

even the other tour guides you pass will tell the people on their tours 'there's the best tour guide in New Orleans... 'Scary Mary.'

We liked her so much we signed up for another walking tour with her tonight...

the 'Ghosts and Vampires' tour in the French Quarter.

It'll be her third tour today and for a woman over forty Mary's really got some incredible energy!

We're headed out the door now and I bet we'll have trouble keepin' up with the woman.","['cemetery', 'exploring', 'freedom', 'ghosts', 'happiness', 'history', ""i can't walk no more"", 'joy', 'karma', 'kindness', 'love', 'loving life', 'scary mary', 'soul-patrol', 'spirits', 'the best tour guide in new orleans', 'the big easy', 'understanding', 'vampires', 'viewminder', 'voodoo']",'Scary Mary' ~ Legendary New Orleans Tour Guide,Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License,27869077@N05,jpg,-90.070745,7025820223,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/,1332995050,2012-03-28 12:15:16.0,29.959684,http://www.flickr.com/photos/27869077@N05/7025820223/,Viewminder,NIKON CORPORATION NIKON D700

"Even though the lake was not at its highest, it stretched on forever!

Tonlé Sap, Cambodia’s Great Lake, lies south of Siem Reap. It is the largest freshwater lake in South East Asia and is an ecological hot spot that was designated as a UNESCO biosphere in 1997.

The Tonlé Sap is unusual for two reasons: its flow changes direction twice a year, and the portion that forms the lake expands and shrinks dramatically with the seasons. From November to May, Cambodia's dry season, the Tonlé Sap drains into the Mekong River at Phnom Penh. However, when the year's heavy rains begin in June, the Tonlé Sap backs up to form an enormous lake. For most of the year the lake is relatively small, around one meter deep and with an area of 2,700 square km. During the monsoon season, however, the Tonlé Sap river, which connects the lake with the Mekong, reverses its flow. Water is pushed up from the Mekong into the lake, increasing its area to 16,000 square km and its depth to up to nine meters, flooding nearby fields and forests.

It was a great trip. We set off down the river in a long tailed boat and passed numerous houses built on tall stilts until we arrived at the floating village on the edge of the lake which is home to many ethnic Vietnamese people. Once at the village we stopped off at a large floating shop/restaurant, looked at the farmed crocodiles and had a drink. We were approached by children paddling washtubs and holding snakes!
We enjoyed seeing another side of Siem Reap – it’s not only temples!","['“tonlé', 'anne cattrell', 'anne roberts', 'cambodia', 'fishing', 'floating', 'lake', 'mekong', 'pondspider', 'river', 'sap', 'sap”', 'siem reap', 'tonle', 'vietnamese', 'villages', 'water']","Looking out over the vast lake, Tonle Sap",Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License,72987657@N00,jpg,,5374438490,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/,1295576927,2010-12-20 12:37:18.0,,http://www.flickr.com/photos/72987657@N00/5374438490/,Pondspider,Canon EOS 450D

"This is the view from in front of our hotel in Mammoth Hot Springs, Wyoming, just north of Yellowstone. The river is raging for sure, but a good 50 feet below the banks, so no danger of flooding here. Also no sign of the oil that spilled upriver in Billings. The deck on the right is an observation deck that lets you stand somewhat over the river.
